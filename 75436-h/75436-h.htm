<h2>CHAPTER I. <br> The Cannezianos</h2>

<p>I knew, that evening in April, when Sam got home
from Rattail and came stamping snow into my
kitchen, his good old red, white, and blue face stretched
long instead of wide in its usual grin, that he had brought
some bad news with him: a slump in the cattle market;
moonshine liquor discovered again, down in the outfit’s
quarters; a delayed shipment of groceries from Salt Lake.
I, who in the months that were coming, was to live
through more shock, and fright, and distress and disaster
than should fall to the lot of a thousand women in all of
their combined lifetimes, was worrying, then, for fear we
should have to be doing without olive oil and canned
mushrooms for a few weeks in the ranch-house!</p>

<p>“I had a letter to-day,” he said, “from the Canneziano
twins.”</p>

<p>I am like a lot of folks who say that they are not
superstitious, who just happen to think that it is bad luck to
walk under a ladder. More than likely the shivery,
creepy sensation I felt, when Sam said that, was due to
the cold he had brought in with him, and was not due to
the fact that those words of his were the forerunners
for all of the grim mysteries and the tragedies that made
the Desert Moon Ranch, before the end of July, a place
of horror.</p>

<p>“How much do they want?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“No, Mary; they want to come here to live.”</p>

<p>“Lands alive! For how long?”</p>

<p>“Danielle wrote the letter. She says they want to
come here and rest, indefinitely. There was quite a bit in
it about the peace of the deserts and the high mountains
here in Nevada. She says she longs for it with all her soul,
or something like that.”</p>

<p>“Danielle,” I said, “always was the best of the two.
You going to let them come, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Anything else for me to do?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing—for you. There’d be plenty for others.
Those girls are no kin of yours. Let me see—they must
be able-bodied young women by now. Eight years old
when they were here in 1909, makes them twenty-four
years old now, according to my figures. Why a couple
of women twins, aggregating forty-eight years, should
decide to come here and rest their souls, at your expense,
is beyond me.”</p>

<p>“I have plenty.”</p>

<p>“So has Henry Ford. Why don’t they go rest their
souls with him? They’ve got as much claim on him as
they have on you. None.”</p>

<p>“I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Where are they now, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Switzerland.”</p>

<p>“Lands alive! I don’t pretend to know much about
foreign geography, but I’ve understood that there were a
few mountains in Switzerland. Leave those girls rest their
souls right there where they are, Sam.”</p>

<p>“No—I don’t know, Mary. I guess I’ll write them a
letter and tell them to come along. Lots of room.”</p>

<p>I didn’t argue any more about it. For twenty-five years
I had been housekeeper of the Desert Moon ranch-house,
and I had learned, during that time, that there was only
one subject, concerning Sam, or the place, on which I
could never hope to have any say-so. Trying to argue with
Sam about anything that had to do, in any way, with
Margarita Ditsie, when she was Margarita Ditsie
Stanley, or when she was Margarita Ditsie Canneziano,
was about as sensible as hoisting a chiffon parasol for
protection in the midst of one of our Nevada mountain
cloudbursts.</p>

<p>Margarita Ditsie was of French-Canadian parentage;
a dark-haired, big-eyed beauty. Her father kept a
gambling hole in Esmeralda County in the early days.
Her mother had run away from a convent, after she had
become a nun, to marry him. The girl had some of the
nun, some of the runaway, and some of the gambling
house proprietor in her. It made a queer combination.</p>

<p>When she was eighteen years old she came from Carson
to visit Lily Trooper, over on the Three Bars Ranch,
in northeastern Nevada, about sixty miles from here.
Sam met her there, at one of Ben Trooper’s big barbecues.
She and Sam were married two weeks later. She was a lot
younger than Sam; but, even then, he was the richest man
in the valley, with every unwedded woman for a hundred
miles around setting her cap for him.</p>

<p>Whether Margarita married him for his wealth, or
whether it was to spite the other girls who would have
liked to marry him, I don’t know. All I know is that
Margarita never had a mite of love for him. She stayed
with him, though, and acted decently enough for two
years, until Dan Canneziano came to the ranch and got
a job on it as cowpuncher.</p>

<p>It was during those two years that Sam built this
ranch-house for her. He had an architect in New York
draw the plans for it; and though now on the outside, with
its towers and trimmings, it looks kind of old fashioned,
I think it is still the finest house in Nevada. Sam’s lead
and silver mine had just come in, and there was not
anything, from Italian marble fireplaces to teakwood floors,
that was too grand for what Margarita called the Stanley
Mansion. She left it, all the elegance and the luxury, and
she broke her marriage vows, for love of this wop cowpuncher.
That, I guess, is fair and full enough description
of Margarita Canneziano.</p>

<p>I don’t blame her. I quit blaming folks for things a good
many years ago when, after firing three Chinese cooks
in six weeks, I decided that, if we were to live healthy and
wholesome, I’d have to take over the job of cooking as
well as housekeeping for the Desert Moon Ranch, and
set about it, and learned to cook. In other words, when I
became a creator myself, I got to know creations and
so quit blaming all of them. If I forget to put the soda
in the sour milk pancakes, it isn’t their fault if they don’t
rise. They are as I made them. Margarita was as the Lord
made her. He, I suppose, either had His own good
reasons for turning out such a mess, or else He was tired,
or flustered, or, maybe, was just experimenting on the
road to something better when He did it.</p>

<p>I should explain, I suppose, wishing to be as honest as
possible in spite of the fact that I am writing a mystery
story, that Canneziano was different from the ordinary
breed of cowpunchers. His father, he claimed, had some
hifaluting title in Italy, before he got into a peck of
honorable, patriotic trouble and had to skip to the United
States to save his neck. That may be true, and it may not.
Canneziano had a good education; he talked poetry,
and played the violin. Margarita heard him playing,
down in the outfit’s quarters one day, and had Sam invite
him up to the house to play. She accompanied him on
the grand piano that Sam had bought for her.</p>

<p>Before long, Dan Canneziano was spending a good part
of his time at the ranch-house. Sam, being nobody’s fool,
soon saw how the land lay; but he, according to his
custom then and now, kept his mouth shut and his eyes
open. Sure enough, one evening they tried to elope
together. Sam went after them and brought them back. I
remember, yet, how the three of them looked, coming into
the house that night.</p>

<p>Margarita, her head high, defiant, but pretty as a fire’s
flame. Canneziano, slinking in at her heels, like a whipped
cur, expecting worse; and Sam, following behind them,
calm as cold turkey. The three of them had about half
an hour’s talk together. Then Sam herded Canneziano
down to the outfit’s quarters and, I suppose, told the
men to keep him there, for there he stayed until Sam was
ready for him again.</p>

<p>The next morning Sam started to the county seat. He
reached there that evening. The following morning he got
his divorce. He came back to the Desert Moon on the
third morning, with his divorce and with a preacher. He
sent for Canneziano, and stood by, while the preacher
married Margarita Stanley to Daniel Canneziano, decent
and regular, according to the laws of Nevada.</p>

<p>There it should have ended. It didn’t, because Sam
never got over loving Margarita. I don’t hold that to
his credit. I see no more virtue in keeping on loving
a person who has proved unworthy of being loved, than
I see in hating a person who has turned out to be blameless,
or in continuing to do any other unreasonable thing.</p>

<p>At any rate, Sam did it. So when, nine years later,
she came back to the Desert Moon, with twin girls,
Danielle and Gabrielle, and said that Canneziano had
deserted her and the children Sam took them all right in.
I don’t know, yet, whether or not they took him in.</p>

<p>Certainly he did not show much surprise when, in
about ten days, Canneziano put in an appearance. Sam
allowed him to get a good start with his threats, and then
he took him across his knees and gave him a sound
spanking, and passed him over to Margarita to dry his
tears, and washed his own hands and went fishing.</p>

<p>That evening he had one of the men hitch up and take
the whole kit and caboodle of Cannezianos to Rattail
in time to catch the east-bound train. I am ashamed to
say that Sam gave them money. I don’t know how much.
I shouldn’t be surprised if it was more than they had
expected to get from their blackmailing scheme. A tidy
sum, I’ll be bound, for shortly after we heard that
Canneziano had opened the finest gambling house south
of the Mason and Dixon line, in New Orleans.</p>

<p>Sam wanted to keep the children. He offered to adopt
them. Margarita would not consider it. But, several times
after that, pale yellow, perfumed letters came to the
Desert Moon, and Sam answered those letters with a
check. Me he answered, each time, with, “It is for the
little girls, Mary. I can’t let little girls go needing.”</p>

<p>When Margarita died, in France, seven years after she
had paid us her blackmailing visit, Sam, the ninny, wrote
to Canneziano and again offered to adopt the girls and
give them a good home on the Desert Moon. He got a few
insulting, insinuating lines for an answer. Canneziano
had his own plans for his daughters, who had developed
into rare beauties. He would thank Sam to keep his hands
off, mind his own business, and so forth.</p>

<p>It would have made a milder man than Sam Stanley
fighting mad. Sam went around all that day, swearing
to me that he was through; that he had made his last
offer of help to the Canneziano family, had sent his last
contribution. I know for certain, though, that he sent
five hundred dollars to Gabrielle, after that, in answer
to a letter she wrote to him. But, if Sam was soft with
the women, he was not soft with Canneziano. He had
showed up here, beaming and broke, about three years
ago. He had left, suddenly, after having seen Sam and no
one else, less beaming but quite as broke as he had been
when he had come. I thought, maybe, Sam was forgetting
that side of the family, and that this might be a good
time to remind him.</p>

<p>“Is Canneziano planning to come on later, too, and
rest?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Just at present he is in San Quentin, serving a three
years’ term. Danielle didn’t say for what deviltry. His
term’s up this summer. That is another reason the girls
want to come here. Somewhere safe from his persecutions,
I think the letter said. Poor little girls,” Sam went on,
“I reckon we haven’t any idea of what they’ve been
through, all these years.”</p>

<p>“I reckon not,” I agreed. “But they aren’t little girls
any more. Seems queer to me, with all the beauty their
father was bragging about, that neither of them has
married. Twenty-four is getting along.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet,” Sam answered, “it is because they have
never had any decent opportunities. You know how
pretty they were as little girls, and how good——”</p>

<p>“Danielle was good enough,” I said. “Gabrielle was a
holy terror.”</p>

<p>Sam let that pass. “Considering,” he continued, “the
life that they’ve had to lead, and all, I think it speaks
pretty well for them that they have come through
straight and clean.”</p>

<p>Instead of asking him how he knew that, I said,
“You’d be willing, then, to have John marry one of
them?”</p>

<p>John, Sam’s adopted son, was the apple of Sam’s eye.
He would have the ranch, and Sam’s fortune, other
dependents provided for, when Sam died. Whether
or not the girl he married would be contented to live on
the ranch, and help John carry it on and keep up its
traditions, making it one of the proudest spots in Nevada,
was a mighty important thing to Sam.</p>

<p>He waited so long before answering my question that
I was sure I had hit the nail on the head.</p>

<p>“John,” he finally said, “is old enough to take care of
himself.”</p>

<p>With that he turned and went out of my kitchen, not
giving me a chance to say that, though I had lived
through fifty-six years, I had never yet seen a man at
the age he had just mentioned. I did not care. I felt too
vimless for even a spat with Sam. I knew that if these
Canneziano girls came to the Desert Moon, they would
bring trouble with them. I was right. A merciful Providence
be thanked that, for a time at least, the knowledge
of how terribly right I was, was spared me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II. <br> John and Martha</h2>

<p>I am not an admirer of men. Looking at most any man,
I find myself thinking what a pity it was he had to
grow up, since as a little, helpless child he would have
made a complete success.</p>

<p>Sam Stanley is different. There is some of the child
left in Sam, just as there is, I think, in any good man or
woman—a little seasoning of simplicity, really, is all it
amounts to—but there is a quality about Sam that
makes a person feel that he set out, early in life, to follow
the recipe for being a man, and that he has made a
thorough job of it. Physically, alone, Sam would make about
three of most men, with plenty left over for gravy. But
it is not that. It is the something that makes him stroll
up, unarmed, to a cowpuncher who is bragging wild with
moonshine and clinking with firearms, and say, in that
drawling, gentle voice of his, “What’s the trouble here,
son?” And the something that makes that cowpuncher
get polite first, and evaporate immediately after. And
Sam whiteheaded, now, at that.</p>

<p>Why he, as a young man, with a pretty fair education
and a tidy sum of money left him by his father, who had
been a well thought of lawyer in Massachusetts, should
come out here to Nevada, take up his homestead land,
and settle content for the rest of his life, has always
been more or less of a mystery to me. I will warn you,
though, that it is a mystery that doesn’t get solved in
this story, unless you care to take Sam’s explanation of it.</p>

<p>He says that, when his father died, it left him without
a relative, whom he knew of, in the world. He was twenty
years old, and he owned a set of roving toes and an
imagination. So he went to California, seeking romance
and gold. Finding neither, he took a small boat named
The Indiana, and went up to Oregon, where he joined
a friend of his, named Tom Cone, who had a place on the
Columbia River near Rooster Rock.</p>

<p>One day Sam was out in the woods—he said there was
nothing to be out in except woods or rain in Oregon in
those days—and he heard a noise behind a thicket. He
thought Tom, who lived for practical jokes, was getting
ready to pull one. So Sam crept up to the thicket, stooping
low and making no noise, and shouted “Boo!” at the
biggest bear he had ever seen in his life. Sam says he has
forgotten what the bear said. He decided, then and there,
that the Oregon forests were no place for a man with no
more sense than he had; he left them, and came down
here to Nevada.</p>

<p>“No forests, no fences, no folks, and a free view for
ten thousand miles,” is the way Sam puts it, “so, I
stayed. It was the first place I’d ever found where I didn’t
feel hampered for room.”</p>

<p>He staked out his hundred and sixty acres with Boulder
Creek tumbling and roaring through them. He built his
cabin, out of railroad ties, in a grove of quaking aspen
trees. He hired help, and built fences, and dug ditches,
and planted crops, and bought stock. He bought more
land. He hired more help, dug more ditches, planted
bigger crops, bought more stock. He has been doing that,
regularly, ever since. And, of course, he located the lead
and silver mine, on his property, that made him millions,
if it made him a cent, before it played out. But, in spite
of the money that “Old Lady Luck,” as he called his
mine, made for him, Sam never gave his heart to it.
It was the Desert Moon Ranch that he loved, and the
money he made from it that he was proud of. That was
why, when the honor of the ranch went under, during
those terrible weeks last summer, Sam all but went under
with it.</p>

<p>After Margarita left the place from her visit of 1909,
taking the twins with her, Sam went around for a week
or two, with his head cocked to one side as if he was
listening for something. I knew what he was missing, and
I was not surprised when, one day, he told me he had
decided to send to San Francisco and get a couple of
children and adopt them.</p>

<p>He wrote to a big hospital in San Francisco and got in
touch with a trained nurse who would be willing to come
up and live on the ranch and take care of the two children.
He had her go to an orphan’s home and select the children
and bring them with her when she came. Sam’s
specifications concerning them were that they were to be a
boy and a girl, under ten and over five years old, healthy,
American, and brown-eyed. (Sam’s own eyes are the color
of ball-bluing, giving his face, with his red cheeks, and
his white beard, the patriotic effect I have mentioned.)</p>

<p>The nurse came early in September with the two
brown-eyed children, named Vera and Alvin. Sam at
once re-named them. John, he said, was the only name
for a boy, and Mary the only name for a girl. But, since
my name was Mary, he would let the little girl have
Martha, which meant, according to Sam, “Boss of the
Ranch.”</p>

<p>The nurse’s name was Mrs. Ollie Ricker. If you can
imagine a blue-eyed, pink-cheeked, yellow-haired bisque
doll, turned old, you will have a good idea of her
appearance at that time. I don’t know how old she was then. I
don’t know how old she is now. Younger by many years
than I am, I am sure; and yet she has always seemed old
to me; old with the sudden but inevitable oldness of a
wrecked ship, or a burned-down house, or a felled tree,
that makes a body forget that a year ago, or perhaps
only yesterday, it was a fresh, new thing. She never
talked. I do not mean that she never chatted, or gossiped.
I mean that she never said one word, not, “Good-morning,”
nor, “Good-night,” nor, “If you please,” nor,
“Thank you,” if she could possibly avoid it. At the end
of sixteen years of daily association with Mrs. Ricker,
that is, up to the time of the second murder on the Desert
Moon, I knew exactly as much about her past life as
you know at this minute.</p>

<p>John, at that time, was nine years old. He was as
bright, and as upstanding, and as handsome, as any little
fellow to be found anywhere; bashful at first, but ready
and glad to be friendly, with an uplifting smile that
wrinkled his short nose and that would wheedle a cooky
out of a pickle jar. I may as well say, now, that this
description of John, at nine years old, is as good a
description as I can give of John at twenty-five, if you
will draw his height up to six feet, and put on weight
accordingly.</p>

<p>Martha, when she came to us, was a frail, white-faced
mite, with enormous brown eyes that looked as if they
had been removed from a Jersey heifer and set in her
white face. The papers from the orphanage gave her age
as five years; but even I, who knew less about children
than it was decent for any woman to know, soon saw
that something was wrong. She walked well enough, but
she could scarcely talk at all. Her ways and her habits
were those of a two-year-old infant, yet she was far too
large for that age. Before she had been with us a week I
knew that Martha was not quite right in her mind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker knew it, too. Her excuse was, that she had
chosen Martha because she was so pretty; that she had
had no opportunity to judge her other characteristics.
She insisted that she thought, with proper care, Martha
would develop normally.</p>

<p>I knew better. Sam knew it, too. But, when I begged
and besought him not to adopt her, he brought out an
argument good and conclusive for him.</p>

<p>“If I don’t adopt her, and take care of her,” said Sam,
“who the heck would?”</p>

<p>So adopt her he did. And he spent a small fortune on
doctors, specialists, for her. None of them could do
anything. It was, they said, a hopeless case of retarded
development. So, at twenty-one years of age, Martha,
though the care and doctoring had given her a fine
healthy body, had the mind of a child of five or six
years—not too bright a child, either. That was at best. At
worst—— Well, no matter. Entirely harmless, the
doctors said; but I always had my doubts.</p>

<p>Sam tried all sorts of teachers for her, too; bringing
them from back east and paying them sums to stagger.
But, in the end, we found that Mrs. Ricker was better
with her than anyone else. She never pretended any
particular love for Martha, but she took care of her,
and kept her sweet and clean, and put up with her
tempers, when many a better woman than Ollie Ricker would
have gone away in disgust. I am not saying that, if there
is a Judgment Day, as many say and some believe, I’d
care to be standing in Ollie Ricker’s shoes, if she is
wearing them at that time; but I do say that her gentleness,
and her patience, through all those years with Martha,
should be counted to her credit, whether or no.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch03">

<h2>CHAPTER III. <br> Hubert Hand</h2>

<p>It was three years after Mrs. Ricker came to the
ranch, bringing John and Martha, that Hubert
Hand put in his appearance. He had got Mr. Indian Chat
Chin, as everybody called him, to bring him up from
Rattail in his old surrey. Hubert Hand was something
of a dude in those days, though he has well outgrown
it since, and I remember yet how comical he looked,
sitting up there so stiff and fine in his light gray overcoat
and gray Fedora hat, with that big Roman nose of his
protruding out and up, disdainfully, above his little
moustache, and apparently above all consciousness of
dirty old Mr. Indian Chat Chin and the rattle-trap rig.</p>

<p>Mr. Indian Chat Chin stopped his old nag at the
entrance to the driveway, and Hubert Hand climbed
carefully down and came up the road, swinging a walking
cane like he was leading a parade.</p>

<p>Sam and I, as was our custom, went walking down to
meet him.</p>

<p>He took off his hat to me, and said to Sam, “I wish to
see the owner of this ranch.”</p>

<p>“Nobody ever mistook me for a fairy before,” Sam
said. “But go ahead. Your first wish is granted. What are
the other two?”</p>

<p>Hubert Hand got out his card then. Besides his name
it had “Clover-blossom Creamery,” and the San
Francisco address printed on it.</p>

<p>“Now, Mr. Stanley,” Hubert Hand went on, after the
embarrassing minute of general introductions, “I am
going to be honest with you——”</p>

<p>“Hold on, stranger,” Sam interrupted, “you’re not.
You are going to be as dishonest as heck. Otherwise, you
wouldn’t bother to tell me you were going to be honest.
Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Hubert Hand laughed, but he didn’t like it. He went
ahead, though, and explained that he had an up-and-coming
creamery business in San Francisco, but that his
physician had told him that he had to live in a high,
dry climate with plenty of sunshine and no fog. He had,
after inquiries and investigations, decided that the Desert
Moon Ranch, altitude seven thousand feet, sunshine
three hundred and sixty-five days in the year, to say
nothing of the marvelous view of the Garnet Mountains,
the hunting, the fishing, and the pure snow water, would
fill all his requirements.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Sam said. “When I get ready to start a
Gold Cure Sanatorium, I’ll drop you a line.”</p>

<p>“You won’t do business, then?” Hubert Hand
questioned.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t heard anything about doing business,” Sam
said.</p>

<p>Hubert Hand’s proposition was that he start a creamery,
on the Desert Moon Ranch, and supply the valley
with ice-cream, butter, and other dairy products. Sam
had the ranch, the cows, and the big ice plant. Mr.
Hubert Hand had the knowledge and the equipment.
They could divide the profits.</p>

<p>Next to sheep men, I guess there is nothing that cow
men hold in lower contempt than they hold dairy farms.
Sam was too much disgusted to swear very long.</p>

<p>“But, do you realize, Mr. Stanley,” Hubert Hand
insisted, “that this entire valley has to depend on Salt
Lake City, or on Reno, for its dairy products?”</p>

<p>“Listen, stranger,” Sam said. “I wouldn’t turn the
Desert Moon into a place to slop milk around in if the
entire valley had to depend on Hong Kong, China, for its
ice-cream cones. Forget it, and come in now and have
some supper.”</p>

<p>To my knowledge, Hubert Hand, from that day to this,
has never again mentioned, on the Desert Moon, anything
that had to do with creameries. Neither, from that
day to this, has he been off the ranch for more than a
couple of weeks at a time.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he began, trying to make it sound
unimportant, when we had finished supper, “I heard, in
Telko, that you were something of a chess player.”</p>

<p>“I am, when I can get a game,” Sam said. “But chess
players, in these parts, are as scarce as hen’s teeth. My
neighbor, thirty miles east of here, and I used to play
regular, two nights a week. But the son of a gun struck
it rich, and like most loyal Native Sons of this state, he
moved to California to spend his money. I’m teaching
my boy, John—but he is just a kid. Here, lately, about all
I’ve done is work out the puzzles by myself.”</p>

<p>“I play a little,” Hubert Hand produced, right
modestly.</p>

<p>Sam jumped up and got out his chess table, inlaid
ebony and ivory, made special, and his ebony and ivory
chess-men.</p>

<p>Hubert Hand beat him the first game in about half an
hour. They set up their men again. It took Hubert Hand
over an hour that time to beat Sam, but he did it.</p>

<p>“Heck!” Sam said, at the end of that game. “You’re
hired.”</p>

<p>“Hired for what?”</p>

<p>“For whatever you want to call it, except the slopping
of milk around. Send for your trunk and name your pay.
Why didn’t you say, in the first place, that you were a
blankety-blank crack chess player?”</p>

<p>I realize, right here, that I am not going to be able to
get through with this entire story, with Sam in it, and
continue to modify his vocabulary into hecks and
blankety blanks. Wrong, I think it is; but it is true, that
men out here do not talk like that. Sam cusses, swears
and damns, just as naturally and as innocently as he
breathes. The only real trouble about Sam’s profanity is
that he uses up all his strong words day by day in ordinary
conversation; so, when occasions arise that call for
something really emphatic, Sam hasn’t any words to do
them justice. If the demands are not too serious, he
reverts and finds a little “Pshaw!” or, “Shoot!” unusual
enough to meet the need. If it goes beyond that, he opens
his mouth in silence and keeps it open, hoping for a word,
until his pipe drops out and scatters ashes and burned
and burning tobacco all over everything. I pay no
attention to his profanity and small attention to his
“Pshaws,” and “Shoots.” But when his pipe drops,
I get right down interested.</p>

<p>To return to Hubert Hand: he accepted Sam’s offer,
then and there. The next day he titled himself assistant
ranch manager, and named his salary at two hundred
and fifty dollars a month. Sam paid it without blinking;
and kept right on managing the ranch, and everything
on it, except, perhaps, myself, without any assistance,
the same as he had always done.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch04">

<h2>CHAPTER IV. <br> Chadwick Caufield</h2>

<p>Chadwick Caufield, the other member of our
household, who was present on the Desert Moon
Ranch at the time of the first murder, came only two
years ago last October.</p>

<p>It was away past bedtime, after ten o’clock, but the
radio was brand-new then, and we were all sitting up,
listening to a fine program given by the Hoot Owls in
Portland, Oregon, when the doorbell rang. Sam answered
it. Chad stepped in.</p>

<p>He was wearing white corduroy trousers, a long, yellow
rubber raincoat, and a straw hat tethered to its buttonhole
with a string. He was carrying a ukulele under his
arm and a camera in his hand. He took off his hat,
displaying a head full of pretty yellow curls. He smiled,
displaying a sweet, gentle disposition. (If there is any
better index to character than the way a person smiles,
I have never found it.)</p>

<p>“How do you do?” he said. “I have come to visit you.”</p>

<p>By the time Sam got his pipe picked up, John had got
down the forty-feet length of living-room and had Chad
by both hands, and was introducing him as the friend
he had told us about, the friend he had made at Mather’s
Field, during the war.</p>

<p>The way of that was, John had saved his life for him
down there, and had never since been able to get out
from under the responsibility of it. John had found a job
for him, after the armistice, and when Chad lost it, John
had loaned him money to start out in a vaudeville act.
He did fine with that for three years, and was making
good money on the Orpheum circuit, when he got into
an automobile accident in Kansas City and was laid up
for months in the hospital there. He went back to work
sooner than he should have, and spent three months
in an Oakland hospital with influenza. John had wired
money to him there, and had asked him, again, to come
for a visit to the Desert Moon. But, since he had had a
standing invitation for years, and since he had sent no
word that he was coming, John was as much surprised
as any of us that evening.</p>

<p>He had walked over, he explained, from Winnemucca, a
distance of a couple of hundred miles. He had had money
to buy a ticket no further than Winnemucca. He had had
a job there, for a while, dish-washing—a fine job he made
of it, I’ll warrant—and had used his earnings to get into
a solo game, hoping to win enough money to pay for his
ticket. He had lost his money, his watch, his coat, vest,
and shirt. The landlady at Winnemucca, he said, wanted
his trunk worse than he did; and, anyway, he never
argued with ladies. She had allowed him to take the
raincoat—a raincoat in this part of Nevada being about
as much use to anybody as a life preserver to a trout—and
the funny straw hat—he had worn both in his vaudeville
act—and the ukulele. Who wouldn’t be glad to let
anyone who wanted to take a ukulele anywhere, take it?
The camera he had found on the road between Shoshone
and Palisade. He had named it, “Unconscious Sweetness,”
and called it “Connie” for short, and he was
always plum daffy about it, taking expected and unexpected
pictures of all of us at all hours and in all places,
and pasting them in big albums with jokes and such
written underneath.</p>

<p>It is hard to give a fair description of Chad. He was a
little, pindling fellow. Around Sam and John and Hubert
Hand he looked about as dainty and trifling as the
garnish around the platter of the Thanksgiving turkey. He
seemed kind of like that, too; like the extra bit of
garnishing that makes life’s platter prettier and
nicer—absolutely useless, maybe, but never cluttery.</p>

<p>Until after he came, I had not realized how little real
laughing any of us had done. We had been happy enough,
and content; but we had never been much amused. He
amused us. He made us laugh. He took the mechanical
player off the old grand piano, and played it as we had
never before heard it played. He spoke pieces and sang
funny songs until we held our sides with laughing. He
was a ventriloquist, and a mimic besides. He could
imitate all of our voices to a T.</p>

<p>He had been with us about a week before any of us
knew that. I was in the kitchen, one day, when I heard
someone come into the butler’s pantry.</p>

<p>“Mary,” Sam’s voice called from there, “you are
fired. Bounced. You haven’t made a cake in two days,
nor doughnuts in three. You are getting too lazy and
worthless for the Desert Moon——”</p>

<p>I tottered; but, just before I fainted clear away, here
came that grinning little ape, dancing and kicking his
heels in an airy-fairy dance, but still speaking in that
gentle, drawling voice of Sam’s.</p>

<p>I laughed until I had to sit down and lean on the table.
I begged him, then, not to give it away for a few days;
and the fun he and I had, for the next week, would make
a book in itself.</p>

<p>Martha adored him. He played with her by the hour.
He made two dolls, Mike and Pat, for her, and he would
let them sit on her knees while he made them talk for her.
He had to treat her as he would treat a child, of course;
but he managed, what the rest of us did not always manage,
to treat her as if she were a good, sensible child, not
too young to be polite to. Chad had the nicest manners
of any man I have ever known.</p>

<p>At the end of November, when he began to talk about
leaving, Sam offered him a hundred and fifty a month to
stay on. He said, like Hubert Hand had said, “What
for?”</p>

<p>“For living,” Sam said.</p>

<p>Chad laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Double it, then,” Sam urged. “I wouldn’t have you
leave the place, and Martha, for three hundred a month;
so why shouldn’t I pay it to have you stay?”</p>

<p>Chad never would take any regular money from Sam.
But he stayed on and got what he needed, such as
clothes, and razor blades and films for Connie, and had
them charged to Sam’s accounts. He called himself the
“Perpetual Guest—P. G.” for short, but some of the
others said it stood for “Pollyanna Gush” and called him
“Polly” to twit him. Pollyanna may not be literature, I
don’t know; but a person of that nature is most
uncommonly pleasant to have around the house.</p>

<p>The only time I ever felt any differently about Chad
was right after Sam broke the news to the assembled
household that we were to be visited by a couple of lady
twins from Switzerland. Chad began, then, to practise
a new song about “sleep, little baby,” and to permit the
most ear-splitting sounds to issue from the back of his
throat. He called it yodeling; and said that yodeling was
Switzerland’s chief export, and that he was practising
up to make the ladies feel at home. I declare, it nearly
drove me out of my wits. A disturbing element, they
were, you see, from the very first.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch05">

<h2>CHAPTER V. <br> The Arrival</h2>

<p>The girls got here on Friday, the eighth of May. Sam
and I rode down to Rattail in the sedan to meet
them, and John took the small truck down to bring up
their baggage.</p>

<p>Number Twenty came roaring up, on time, and stopped
with a snort of angry protest, as it always does when it
has to stop at Rattail, which is not often; not more than
a dozen times a year at best, I guess.</p>

<p>Sam and I hurried down the tracks to where the
porter’s white, rapidly swinging arms were piling up the
shining black baggage.</p>

<p>I don’t know what there is about riding in a train that
turns folks haughty and supercilious; but there is
something that does. A person who would be right hearty and
human on his own two feet, sits in a car window and looks
out at the platform people as if they were something
he wanted to be careful not to step in. By the time I
had passed fifty or more windows, and had reached where
the girls were standing, I was so heated up I couldn’t
find a word to say but, “Pleased to meet you,” which
was not the truth.</p>

<p>One of them smiled real sweet, and said, “Mary! Upon
my soul you haven’t changed at all in sixteen years,”
and made as if to kiss me; which I did at once.</p>

<p>The other one gave me a jerky nod, and stood there,
watching the train pull out, until Sam, who had been
poking along behind me, managed to catch up.</p>

<p>“Uncle Sam,” she exclaimed, laughing and standing on
tiptoe, and putting her hands on his shoulders, and
tipping her pointed chin up to him, “you dear, to have us!
I had always remembered that you were the biggest man
in the world, and now I see that I was right about it.”</p>

<p>Sam didn’t kiss her, as she had expected him to. He
patted her hands, took them down off his shoulders and
held them a minute before he dropped them and reached
to shake hands with the twin who had kissed me.</p>

<p>“Well, now,” he said, “this is sure great. Little girls all
grown up to ladies, and coming to see their old uncle.”
(He had bitten on that uncle bait, though he was no more
their uncle than I was.) “Which of you is which, now?
Let’s get you sorted out, so I can call you by name. I
used to get you all mixed up, when you were little
tykes—couldn’t tell one from the other.”</p>

<p>“You won’t have that trouble any more,” said the one
who had nodded at me. “I am Gabrielle, and that prim
little puss is Danielle. People never get confused about
us any longer.”</p>

<p>Indeed, I should think not. Danielle was dressed pretty
and neat in a suit of gray about the shade of a Maltese
cat, with a nice little round hat to match, and not more
than ten inches of gray silk stocking showing between the
edge of her skirt and the tops of her neat gray pumps.
Gabrielle had on a floppy coat thing, that looked more
like a bathrobe, cut off at the knees, the way it lopped
and draped, with nothing but a big buckle on one hip
to hold it together at all. It was about two shades darker
than good cream tomato soup. Her hat was as near as she
could match it, I guess; and, though it was small, it was
soft and loppy. Her stockings, sixteen inches of them in
sight, if an inch, were a kind of sickly cross between
yellow and pink. Her black satin shoes had stilt heels
and silver buckles. She wore, also, a pair of earrings,
dangling almost to her shoulders, that looked like the
spinners the boys use here, in the fall, when they go after
the big trout.</p>

<p>The population of Rattail had come running to the
depot, of course, when the train stopped; and, at last,
swaggering his way among males, females, Indians,
cowpunchers, and dogs, here came John.</p>

<p>He doesn’t usually trim his walk with that swagger;
but, bashful as an overfed coyote, he is hard put to it, at
times, to cover up this deficiency of his. So he swings his
shoulders, and talks loudly, and boasts around, when a
person with a keen ear could hear his knees clicking
together.</p>

<p>“La-la!” exclaimed Gabrielle, when she caught sight
of him. “Who is this picturesque man thing coming
toward us?”</p>

<p>John did look pretty fine, wearing his new corduroy
suit, and his shining new leather puttees, and his new
sixteen-dollar sombrero. He had even gone so far as to
button up the collar of his brown flannel shirt. I was
sorry he had not been around, when the train came in, to
add tone to Sam and to me.</p>

<p>“He,” Sam answered, beaming with pride, “is my boy,
John.”</p>

<p>“How thrilling!” chirped Gabrielle. “It is like living
in a cinema, isn’t it, Danny?” And off she went, sort of
skipping along the tracks, to meet him.</p>

<p>When they met, John gave her about the same attention
that a passenger gives the ticket chopper at the
gate, in a city depot, when he sees the train he is trying
to catch moving slowly out through the yards. He pulled
off his hat with a bow, but he passed her, walking very
fast. I thought that he was so flustered that he did not
know what he was doing. He knew. He was headed
straight for Danny. He had been in the freight house
since long before the train came in, sizing up from a safe
distance the girls’ arrival. Then he had sneaked out the
back way, up past the station house, and around it and
back again, to give the appearance of having just that
minute got into Rattail.</p>

<p>“John,” I said, when he reached Danny and me, and
stopped short, like he had just been lassoed from the
rear, “this is Danielle Canneziano.”</p>

<p>John dropped his hat in the alkali dust, his new hat,
and reached out and took both of Danny’s hands in his.
Falling on his knees in front of her would not have been
much showier.</p>

<p>“I—” he produced, “I—I heard you laugh.”</p>

<p>To me, it barely made sense; but she seemed to find it
interesting and important.</p>

<p>“Really?” she said, and sort of trilled it full of
meaning.</p>

<p>Standing there, with my new shoes hurting my corns,
and Sam and Gabrielle completely out of sight around the
corner of the depot, I felt as necessary, useful, and
welcome as a hair in the soup, and a sight more conspicuous.
Rattail’s population was beginning to close in around us.
I pulled at John’s sleeve; but I declare, if a freight hadn’t
come along, forcing those two to get off the tracks, they
might have been standing there yet, gazing into each
other’s eyes.</p>

<p>I was halfway home, riding beside Danny in the sedan,
when Gabrielle’s laughing out again, at some remark of
Sam’s, made me remember that she had been the only
one who had done any laughing when we had met. Danny
had only smiled. So, if that laugh was what had put John
clear off his head, he had picked the wrong twin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI. <br> The Secret</h2>

<p>The first minute I heard that the Canneziano girls
were coming to the Desert Moon, I was certain that
they were not coming for the peace of the mountains
and the deserts. Going on from there, I questioned
myself as to what reason any Canneziano had ever had for
coming to the ranch, or for writing to the ranch. The
answer was, to get money. I tried to think that they
would stay a few months, long enough to put themselves
in Sam’s good graces, ask him for a tidy sum, and leave.
But they had not been on the place two days before I
knew that, though that might be a minor part of their
plan, it was not the major part; that there was something
far less simple, something, probably, treacherous
and sinister at the root of this visit of theirs to the Desert
Moon.</p>

<p>On the evening of their arrival the girls had unpacked
their trunks in their bedrooms. The next morning the
boys carried their trunks to the attic. Going through the
upper hall, later that same morning, I saw one of the
empty drawers that had fitted into their new-fangled
trunks, lying beside the door to the attic stairway.</p>

<p>I hate clutter. I picked it up and carried it upstairs.
I went in all good faith: but I wear rubber-soled shoes
around the house, and the stairs are thickly carpeted; so
the girls, who were up there, did not hear me coming.
Just before I got to the turn in the stairs, I heard one of
them say:</p>

<p>“I am sure that there is no use in searching the house.
In the first place, he never could have gotten it into the
house without being seen.”</p>

<p>“You are too sure of everything, when you are unsure
of anything,” the other girl answered, and I thought,
since the voice was louder and, somehow, richer, that it
was Gaby’s. “Stop being sure, and try being sensible.
We must find it. We have very little time. How do you
know whether he could have brought it into the house or
not? There is a back stairway.”</p>

<p>Fool that I was, I kept right on going up the stairs.
It took me a while to develop the poll-prying,
eavesdropping, sneaking, and generally despicable character
that I did develop later.</p>

<p>“Did you girls lose something?” I asked, when my
head had poked up to where I could see them.</p>

<p>Danny jumped, from being startled, but Gaby never
turned a hair.</p>

<p>“Only a trinket of Dan’s,” she said. “Possibly she
never packed it at all.”</p>

<p>I gave them the trunk drawer and came back
downstairs, wracking my brain with questions.</p>

<p>Who was the “he” who had, or who had not, gotten
something into the house? The something that they must
find, and had very little time in which to find it. And,
land’s alive, what was the something?</p>

<p>I resolved to say nothing, but to watch those two
girls, like a hawk, from then on. I did so. But it was three
weeks before I heard anything more at all, though I saw
a great deal.</p>

<p>I saw those girls searching, searching everlastingly, the
entire place. I saw them go to the cabin, and stay inside
of it for hours. I saw them in the barnyards, and in the
barns, searching. I saw them down in the outfit’s quarters
when the men were all away. I heard them get up late at
night, and sneak out of the house, and come back in the
early hours of the morning. And, once or twice, I thought
that I saw them seeing me, as I watched them, and then
I was afraid.</p>

<p>It was during these three weeks that Danny and John
announced their engagement. My own opinion is that
they got themselves engaged the first five minutes they
were alone together; but that they had gumption enough
to wait for ten days before telling it.</p>

<p>Sam gave them his blessing. That is to say, he said
that any agreement they wanted to make was all right
with him, if Danny was sure she would be satisfied to live
on the Desert Moon, and if they would wait a year to
be married. They agreed to this, the year of waiting,
reluctantly. Sam, whose one bad habit, not counting
his pipe, is using suitable and unsuitable quotations
on all suitable and unsuitable occasions, assured
them that a year was as a day on the Desert Moon; but
that didn’t seem to make them any happier. The only
people who were downright pleased with Sam’s decision
were Gaby and myself. I, for certain reasons of my own.
Gaby, because she was choosing to consider herself also
in love with John.</p>

<p>I realize that this is crowding pretty fast what the
books call “love interest.” I realize, too, that I have
not given any description of John that would account
for two traveled ladies coming to the Desert Moon and,
at once, falling in love with him.</p>

<p>He had, as I guess I’ve signified, a heap more than his
share of masculine good looks. Outside of hat and collar
advertisements, I don’t know that I’ve ever seen even
pictures of men that were any better looking than John
was. The way he lived, and dressed, and rode, made him
sort of romantic, too, I suppose. A Santa Fe man, who
met him once when he was taking cattle back east for
Sam, offered him a surprising salary to come to the
Grand Canyon and live around there, in order to impress
and delight the eastern young lady tourists. John was
simple-hearted, and slow spoken; but I guess most women
don’t mind that in men. Too, he was a good boy, all the
way through. And, of course, he had plenty of money,
now, and would have a million or more, not counting the
ranch, when Sam died.</p>

<p>Gaby made no bones about her feelings for John. I did
not do as John did, and set all of her open advances
toward him down to sister-in-lawly affection. Still, I
didn’t believe that she really thought she was in love
with John, until I hid in the clothes-closet that evening
and heard Danny and her talking together.</p>

<p>The closet arrangement was a fortunate one for my
purposes. It was between the girls’ rooms, with heavily
curtained doorways leading into each room, and a door
at the end with a transom for ventilation, leading into
the hall. This closet had originally been a part of the hall,
going down between the two rooms. But, in 1912, when
Sam had had the ranch-house remodeled, inside, they had
turned the closet spaces for these rooms into two
bathrooms, necessitating the present arrangement of a double
closet.</p>

<p>The dozens of gowns and frocks—nothing so ordinary
as mere dresses—that the girls had brought with them,
hanging on padded hangers from the long rods, made as
good a hiding place as anyone could ask for; especially,
since I always took care to unscrew the light globe in
the closet when I went in, so that it seemed to be all
right, but would not light when the wall switches were
pressed.</p>

<p>I had gone in there so many evenings, during the past
three weeks, and had heard nothing for my pains that
it was a wonder I had decided to try it again that
evening. It was not luck, though. Gaby’s actions, that
evening, toward John had been so downright disgusting,
sitting on the arm of his chair, and trying to coax him
out of the house to see the mountains by moonlight, and
hanging herself around his neck when they danced
together, and so on, that I had a notion Danny might have
a little conversation ready for her when she could get
her alone.</p>

<p>I had waited about ten minutes when I heard the door
of Gaby’s room open. I was so tickled I all but squealed,
when I heard that Danny had come in with her, instead
of going on down the hall to her own room. Evidently
they had begun their conversation in the hall, for Gaby’s
first words were, “Jealous, my dear Dan?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But it is silly for you to act as you do.
John is in love with me.”</p>

<p>“Since you are so certain of that, why do you object
to my poor little efforts?”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you. Because they are silly. And—not
kind. Why should you try to take him away from me,
when you don’t want him yourself?”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of that, too?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am. His good looks fascinate you, and so does
his unsophistication. You’d like the fortune he is to
inherit. But you would never be satisfied to marry him
and live right here for the remainder of your life.”</p>

<p>“No, I would not. I’d marry him, if he didn’t have a
penny—it is you who are always thinking about his
fortune—but I wouldn’t allow him to bury himself, and
his beauty, and charm in this God-forsaken country.
I’d get him out into the world, and have him take his
place there. With his ability and energy, and with me to
help him, what a place it might be! For you to have him
is—waste. Waste. You don’t know anything about
love. You’ll never learn. I—I tell you I can’t bear it. It
isn’t fair——” She began to cry, hollow sounding sobs, that
seemed to catch in her throat and wrench free from it.</p>

<p>“Gaby. Gaby, dear. Please don’t. I am sorry——”</p>

<p>“Waste. Waste. Waste. You are not sorry. Don’t touch
me!”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Gaby. But what can I do? I couldn’t give
John to you, if I wished to.”</p>

<p>“You could give me a chance.”</p>

<p>“No, I couldn’t.”</p>

<p>“You are a coward.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. I love him. He means to me, too, peace, and
security, and decent living—the things I want most for
my life. Why should I risk it all?”</p>

<p>“Coward! Coward! Peace and security! He means life
to me. All of it; full and complete. Love, and passion,
and adventure and attainment, for him and for me, too.
Do you think I’ll stand by, and allow you to have him,
to bury his wonder in your peace, and smother his
possibilities with your security and decent living?”</p>

<p>“I think,” Danny answered, “that you will have to.
John and I love each other; and we are going to keep each
other. You, nor anyone, can change that.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I should tell John why we came here?”</p>

<p>“You won’t do that. You can’t harm me without harming
yourself. But, if you threaten that, just once more, I
will go straight to John and tell him the truth——”</p>

<p>“You promised——”</p>

<p>“I haven’t broken my promise. I shan’t, if you don’t.
But you must know that I haven’t any interest left in
the thing.”</p>

<p>“What about your desire for revenge?”</p>

<p>“That desire was yours, not mine. I never considered
that side of it at all.”</p>

<p>“Coward! Quitter! Stool-pigeon——”</p>

<p>“That isn’t fair, Gaby. I’ll help if I can. I have been
helping, haven’t I? I won’t hinder in any way. But the
time is short now. Remember that.”</p>

<p>“Danny——” There was a new tone in Gaby’s voice,
sweet like, and appealing. I did not trust it for a minute;
but I think Danny did, for she answered, gently, “Yes,
dear?”</p>

<p>“Forgive me. Let’s be twinny again. Friends?” I
could hear the treachery in that as plainly as I could hear
the words. I think Danny did not hear it, for she
answered, “I do want to be friends, Gaby. I do, truly.
Only—please, dear, won’t you leave my man alone?”</p>

<p>“And you’ll help me. And you won’t tell
him—anything?”</p>

<p>“Of course I won’t tell, Gaby. It is really your secret,
now; not mine. And I’ll help you all I can.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII. <br> Three Rings</h2>

<p>Revenge. Out of all that crazy conversation the
one word kept pestering me like a leaking faucet.
No matter what I was doing, or thinking, that word,
revenge, kept drip, drip, dripping, until my mind was
fairly drenched with it. I got all mixed up about it. Did
people revenge other people, or have revenge on them,
or—what? I looked it up in the dictionary. “Malicious
injuring in return for an injury or offense received.”</p>

<p>I got a piece of paper and wrote it down. “The
Canneziano girls want to injure, maliciously, some one
on the Desert Moon Ranch, in return for an injury or an
offense received.” I crossed out “The Canneziano girls,”
and wrote, “Gabrielle Canneziano,” since Danny had
said that she had never considered that side of it at all.
It did not help any. It did not make sense.</p>

<p>Since Sam and I were the only people on the ranch
they had known before they came here this time, it
seemed as if they had come to injure, maliciously, one of
us. I had never done either of them a mite of harm in my
life. Sam had never done anything but good for them.
Of course, Sam had not been very gentle with their
father. But, as I took pains to discover, neither of them
had any kind feelings for their father. Gaby said, straight
out, that she hated him. Danny, who was too gentle
speaking to use such a word as hate, said that she had
never liked him, never loved him. Both of them laid their
mother’s death at Canneziano’s door. They thought that
his cruelty and his neglect had killed her. It was senseless
to suppose that they were harboring a grudge against
Sam for anything that he had ever done to Canneziano.</p>

<p>Of course, I see now that all that part of it was as plain
as the Roman nose on Hubert Hand’s face. How I missed
seeing it, even then, I don’t know. I was, I guess, like
a little boy so busy trying to watch all three rings at the
circus at one time that he missed the elephant parade.</p>

<p>The Desert Moon was like that sure enough; like a
three ring circus, during the months of May and June.
There were the girls, everlastingly searching for
something: leaving the house shortly after the men left it,
each morning; returning, tired out, just in time for
dinner; off again for the afternoon, and coming home just
in time to pretty up for supper. After a while, I began
to lose interest in that; and, being a woman, I allowed
my attention to become distracted by the center ring
where all the love interest was going on.</p>

<p>Not that Danny and John were interesting. If there is
anything that will make two people duller to all other
people than being engaged to each other, I am sure I don’t
know what it is. Gaby’s unceasing efforts to win John
away from Danny were interesting enough, I suppose, to
folks who can stand to look at that sort of thing. Personally,
I shut my eyes to it as much as possible. Most of my
attention I gave to the clown in the ring—to Chad.</p>

<p>I can not explain it, now or ever; but Chad, from the
very first, was head over heels in love with Gaby. He had
no more chance of winning her, penniless, funny, kind
little fellow that he was, than an amateur has of riding
an outlaw pony. I told him that, once, in those very
words.</p>

<p>“I know it, Mary,” he said. “But you are wrong about
one thing. I’m not riding for a fall. I’m not even mounted.
I know I haven’t a chance with her. I know I can’t pull
one of those stars out of the sky up there with a fishhook.
I’m not trying. But I can sit here in the dark and look
at the stars, can’t I? Stars make all the difference—in the
dark. And, maybe, sometime I can serve her in someway.
That’s all I ask. . . .” So on. If it hadn’t been
Chad, and therefore heartbreaking, it would have been
downright funny.</p>

<p>She never gave him two looks. He couldn’t even make
her laugh with his jokes and his songs, as he could the
rest of us. Once she did deign to allow him to try to teach
her the trick of his ventriloquism. She could not learn it,
and she was furious with him, and said that he did not
want her to learn it. But he followed her about, and
waited on her. He brought her pony up to the house,
instead of allowing one of the outfit to do it. He brought
her desert flowers, which she tossed away to wither. If
Connie hadn’t had a strong constitution he would have
worn her out, taking pictures of Gaby. Page after page in
his album filled with, “Gaby by the window;” “Gaby
on the porch;” “Gaby and Danny starting on a walk;”
“Gaby in riding costume;” Gaby here, there, and
everywhere. And Martha half mad with jealousy.</p>

<p>Right at first, I think that some of the others thought
that Martha’s jealousy was something of a joke. I never
did think so. Before long we all began to feel that it was
more than a little serious. Sam talked to Chad, and to
Gaby about it. Chad did the best he could, after that, to
be as attentive to Martha as he had been before; but, if
he so much as opened a door for Gaby, Martha would
go into temper fits, and sulking spells.</p>

<p>As for Gaby, Sam’s talk with her made things worse.
She had never noticed Chad at all, so she had not noticed
that Martha was jealous of him. She welcomed the news
as another tool she could use to tease and torment the
poor girl. All along she had delighted in teasing and
tormenting Martha, though she had dared not do it when
Sam was present.</p>

<p>The very evening after Sam had talked to her in the
morning, Gaby went and sat beside Chad and curled his
pretty, yellow curls around her finger.</p>

<p>It was a cloudy evening, not chilly; but Sam had
lighted the fire as he always does when he has half an
excuse, and Martha was sitting in front of it, pretending
to read a magazine. She had been pretending to read that
same magazine, on the same page, for the last five years.
She seemed to get pleasure out of sitting and holding it
in her hands. No other magazine would do.</p>

<p>Of a sudden, this evening, she thrust the magazine
in the flames for an instant, jerked it out, and rushed at
Gaby with the burning torch. No harm was done. John
snatched it and tossed it back into the fireplace. But all
of us, except Gaby, had the good sense to be thoroughly
frightened.</p>

<p>Things weren’t ever quite the same for Martha after
that. No other magazine, or picture book, would take
the place of the one she had burned. She would wander
about the house, evenings, quietly, but restless, like a
cat who had lost her kittens.</p>

<p>One of Gaby’s pleasant little ways was to refer to
Martha as an idiot, right before her face.</p>

<p>“La-la!” Gaby exclaimed one evening, when Martha
was wandering about. “The idiot gets on my nerves.
Can’t you make her keep still, Mrs. Ricker?”</p>

<p>“She isn’t harming anyone,” I said, since Mrs. Ricker,
as usual, said nothing. “You leave her alone, and stop
talking like that, Miss.”</p>

<p>“I’m not harming anyone, now,” Martha piped up.
“But someday I might. I’d like to. I won’t, though,”
she walked over close to Gaby, “if you’ll give me the gold
monkey. I’ll be good then, for always.”</p>

<p>It was a bracelet charm of Gaby’s, a gold monkey,
about the size of a large almond, with jade eyes. The
minute Martha had seen it she had begun to beg for it.
There weren’t any monkeys in the jewelry catalogs, but
Sam sent off and got her a bear and a turtle. She wouldn’t
have any truck with them. She wanted that one, particular
monkey. Gaby would not give it to her; would not so
much as allow her to wear it for a few hours at a time.
As usual, this evening, she refused to let Martha touch
it.</p>

<p>“Yes, and you’ll be sorry,” Martha threatened.</p>

<p>She went upstairs and emptied a can of pepper in
Gaby’s handkerchief box.</p>

<p>She was always playing tricks of the sort on Gaby, if
we did not watch her. For my own part, I wouldn’t have
bothered with watching her but for the fact that, more
than often, she got the two girls mixed up and it was
Danny whose pretty dress would be tied to the chair to
tear, instead of Gaby’s; or Danny’s hair would receive the
contents of Chad’s paste-pot; and then Martha, discovering
her mistake, would make herself ill with crying and
remorse. Just as she had hated Gaby from the start, she
had loved Danny; but she could not tell them apart.</p>

<p>It seemed incredible that even Martha could be confused
about the two girls; because, if ever girls were
opposites, those girls were. Of course, they were the same
size, about five feet and two inches tall, I should judge,
and the same weight—both of them too skinny to my
way of thinking, flat as bread-boards. Their faces, just
their faces, did look alike. They both had long brown
eyes, straight noses, small mouths—Gaby painted her
lips until they looked much fuller and more curved than
Danny’s—pointed chins, and complexions the color of
real light caramel frosting. Danny’s cheeks showed a
faint pink, coming and going. Gaby painted her cheekbones,
clear back to her ears, with a deep orange-pink
color. They both had wavy, dark brown hair, cut just
the same in the back, real close fitting and down to a
point. But Gaby brushed her hair straight back from her
forehead, and put varnish stuff on it till it was as sleek
and shining as patent leather. She left all of her ears
showing, and she always wore big earrings, dangling
from them. Danny parted her hair on the side, and
allowed it to wave, loose and soft and pretty. She never
wore earrings. Gaby’s clothes were all loud colored, or
seemed to be—black turned gaudy when she put it on—and
they were all insecure appearing, too defiant of paper
patterns to be quite moral. Danny’s clothes were as neat
and quiet as a pigeon’s.</p>

<p>No wonder that these frequent mistakes of Martha’s
made me decide that she was losing her eyesight. I spoke
to Sam about it, suggesting that Mrs. Ricker would
better take her to San Francisco to visit an oculist.</p>

<p>According to his usual custom, Sam laughed at me.
He said that he had about concluded that Martha was
the only one on the place who could use her eyes to see
deeper than gee-gaws and fol-de-rols.</p>

<p>“If you are insinuating,” I said, “that those two girls
are alike in any respect, inside or outside, you’ve lost
your senses.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t they be alike?” Sam questioned.
“They are twin sisters. They were brought up together,
they have had the same friends, the same teaching, the
same environments. Of course they are alike. One
of them is play-acting. I don’t know which one. I suspect
Danielle, on account of John.”</p>

<p>I may as well state, right here, that all of this remark
of Sam’s, with the exception of the girls being twin sisters,
was a mistake from beginning to end. I didn’t, at that
time, know much of anything about their past lives. I did
know their present characters. I told him so.</p>

<p>He laughed again, and wanted to know what had become
of all my theories concerning our modern young
girls. Ever since the war, I had been standing up for
them, through thick and thin.</p>

<p>“It takes a pretty stout theory,” I admitted, “to hear
a young lady called a ‘damn good sport,’ and see her
receive it as a choice compliment.”</p>

<p>“Who said that to who?” Sam wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Who do you suppose? Hubert Hand to Gaby, of
course.”</p>

<p>“Hubert Hand,” Sam said, “had better behave
himself.”</p>

<p>Since Hubert Hand was too selfish ever to love anything
that his Roman nose wasn’t attached to, his carryings
on with Gaby should be classed, I think, not in the
center ring, but as the main attraction of the third ring.
And he almost old enough to be her father, with white
coming into his hair at his temples!</p>

<p>To this day I have never understood those two, during
those months. Gaby was in love with John. Hubert Hand
was in love with Hubert Hand. Yet they hugged and
kissed, and seemed to think that calling it “necking”
made it respectable. It wasn’t a flirtation, with them.
It was more like a fight, where each of them was fighting
for something they did not want. A perfectly footless,
none too wholesome performance.</p>

<p>“You make him behave himself, Sam,” I urged.</p>

<p>“He is free, white and twenty-one. And she sure can
take care of herself, if ever a girl could. It’s none of my
put-in.”</p>

<p>“What about the rest of us,” I said, “forced to watch
such goings on?”</p>

<p>“Don’t watch. If you watch Belle, and Sadie and
Goldie, that is watching enough for one woman.”</p>

<p>Belle, Sadie and Goldie were the Indian women I had,
at that time, to help me around the place. I suppose they
were pretty good girls. They did all the actual work there
was to do around the house, except the cooking, with me
directing them every step they took. But when I
remember how they all deserted me, in the time of our
terrible trouble, it makes me so fighting mad that I don’t
like to give them credit for anything, nor think about
them at all, even yet.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII. <br> Atmosphere</h2>

<p>The girls had been on the Desert Moon a little better
than six weeks when, one evening, Sam came out into
my kitchen were I was setting bread. Belle, Sadie and
Goldie had gone home, and I had tidied up after them,
as usual, and everything in the kitchen was sweet, and
clean, and shining. I had the doors tight shut, so I
couldn’t hear the radio screeching away in the
living-room, and the windows open, and the evening breeze
fresh from the deserts came in, blowing back my ruffled
white curtains and purifying the air.</p>

<p>“Mary,” Sam began, real solemn for him, “the
ancients used to have cities that they called cities of
refuge. No matter what a fellow had done, if he could
get inside into one of those cities, he was safe. Your
kitchen always kinda seems like that to me—a city
of refuge.”</p>

<p>“Lands, Sam,” I said, “what have you been up to that
you are heading this safety first movement?”</p>

<p>To tell the truth, I was a little put out with him for
moseying in there when I was setting bread. Like most
men I’ve known, Sam never had any particular hankering
for my company unless he thought I could be of some
use to him. Generally, I am glad and proud to help Sam,
anyway I can; but not when I am setting bread. There is
something about setting bread that gives any moral
woman a contented, uplifted feeling that she likes to
indulge in, undisturbed.</p>

<p>“I haven’t been up to anything,” Sam answered, “and
I don’t aim to be. But, Mary, some time ago you came to
me with some suspicions. I laughed them off. I am not
laughing now. I’m worried. Queer things are going on
around here. What I want to know, now, is what do you
know?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. What do you know?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>“What do you suspect, then, Sam?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. What do you?”</p>

<p>“Nothing.”</p>

<p>That, I see now, wouldn’t have been a bad place for us
both to laugh. Neither of us did.</p>

<p>“Have you any idea,” Sam questioned, “why the girls
go prowling all over the place, afoot and horseback,
day-times, and night-times, too, when they should be in their
beds?”</p>

<p>I unfolded a dishtowel and spread it over my pan of
bread. It was ready for rising and I had not got a bit of
uplift out of it.</p>

<p>“If I told you,” I said, “you’d only speak your little
memory-gem, about so much good in the worst of us.”</p>

<p>“No, I won’t, Mary. I’m all set for listening.”</p>

<p>“Well, all I know is just what I’ve known all along.
They are hunting for something.”</p>

<p>“Sure they are hunting for something. But what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. But, whatever it is, they are going to
use it to get revenge, to injure maliciously somebody.”</p>

<p>“Revenge, hell!” Sam said.</p>

<p>“Have it your own way. Only I happened one night to
hear Gaby say to Danny that they had come to this
ranch for the purpose of revenge.”</p>

<p>“Revenge, hell!” Sam repeated himself. “Unless they
are sore at me about Canneziano.”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make sense. They hate Canneziano. I’ve
about decided that they have come here to get revenge
on, maliciously injure, someone who isn’t on the place.”</p>

<p>“ ‘Brighten the corner where you are,’ ” Sam scoffed.
“But never mind. What else did they say, when you
happened to overhear this revenge remark?”</p>

<p>If he was ready, at last, to listen, I was more than
ready to tell what little I knew. I told; even to confessing
about hiding in the clothes closet.</p>

<p>“Well, well,” he drawled, when I had finished my
story, “we are probably making a mountain out of a
molehill. I wouldn’t go pussy-footing around after them,
any more, if I were you, Mary. There’s a screw loose
somewhere, that’s sure; but it is not in the Desert
Moon’s machinery. We’ve got nothing on our
consciences. We don’t need to worry.”</p>

<p>Don’t need to worry! Sam and I, sitting in that peaceful
kitchen, talking so smart and frivolous, and deciding
that we did not need to worry is a memory I could well be
shed of. We didn’t need to worry a bit more than if I’d
used arsenic in my covered pan of bread; not a bit more
than if there had been a den of rattlesnakes in the
cupboard under the sink, or gasoline instead of water in the
tank on the back of the stove. That is how safe and
peaceful we really were, at that minute, if we had had sense
enough to know it. When I realize that four weeks from
that very evening, three people——</p>

<p>But I guess it would be better to tell things straight
along, as they happened. It seems to me a good book can
not be hurried, any more than a good cake can. “Mix and
sift the dry ingredients,” is the way all recipes for cakes
begin.</p>

<p>However, since I suspected that I knew a sight more
about making a good cake than I did about making a
good book, and since the young man from back
east—Indiana—in Nevada for his matrimonial health as are
about half of the population here, happened in just after
I had finished writing the above paragraph, I asked him
whether he would, for a consideration, read and
correct my manuscript.</p>

<p>He had said, when he had come in from his fishing on
Boulder Creek, that afternoon, and asked to buy a meal,
that he was an author by profession. The looks of him
almost made me decide not to put myself in his class. I
don’t know why it is that easterners, coming out here
and buying the same sort of clothes that our men wear,
look so ridiculous in them; but they do. Anyway, I
invited him to stay to supper, and then, as I have said,
made the proposition about the manuscript.</p>

<p>He said that he would be only too happy to edit the
yarn, but that it would probably take him several days to
do it efficiently. In other words, though he grandly
refused the consideration, he got three full days of board
and rooms and fishing on the Desert Moon in return for
around two hours of work. And I got my clean pages all
marked up with “whoms” and “whichs” and funny dodad
marks. It took me more than two hours to get them
all erased.</p>

<p>“Now,” he said, when he finally had read it, “I am
going to be frank with you. You mention dry ingredients.
In my opinion, you have far too many dry ingredients,
and it is taking you much too long to accomplish the
mixing process.</p>

<p>“A book, to be successful, has to move swiftly. This is
particularly true of stories of crime and their detection.
A properly constructed story of this sort, begins with
the murder. The wisest thing for you to do, is to burn all
of this that you have done, and make a fresh beginning,
at the time of the first murder.</p>

<p>“In the new copy, do attempt to get in some atmosphere.
You must make your readers feel the setting, as
it were. Bring them across the wide and multicolored
deserts that lie between here and Telko, to this
marvelous farm. Show them the massive mountain ranges
surrounding it; let them breathe the rarefied air, drink
deeply of the beauty. Give them the changing colors of
the mountains, from their jade greens to their rich ruby
hues, with the purpling cloud shadows swaying across
them. Let them hear the scurrying of the desert rats, the
calls of the owls, the howls of the coyotes. Paint for them
the slender white trunks of your aspen trees, and the
green quivering of their leaves. The harsh, rugged
beauty, the color, the wonder of this northeastern Nevada
of yours is marvelous beyond description. But for all of it
that your manuscript shows, the action might have taken
place on a chicken farm in Vermont.”</p>

<p>“If the folks who read this story,” I said, “are
downright pining for Nevada atmosphere, let them come out
here and get it. There is plenty for all. A mile and a half
of it, statistics show, for each person now in the state.
Nobody ever reads the descriptions in a story, anyway.
I’ve decided that authors put them in for the same
reason that a cook, when unexpected company comes,
makes a double amount of dressing for the chicken, or
serves her creamed canned oysters on toast—to fill up,
to make enough to go around.”</p>

<p>“Well, Mrs. Magin,” he said, “I can only remark that
as an author you are a most excellent cook.”</p>

<p>“When I heard the first variation of that,” I said,
“years, and years, and years ago, I thought it was a little
comical.”</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he answered. “I thought that you were
the sort of person who would appreciate sincere criticism,
even though it might not be wholly complimentary.”</p>

<p>“Job wasn’t,” I told him, “and I don’t set up to be
any better than he was. What is more, if you can point to
any man or woman in history or out of it, who ever did
appreciate sincere, uncomplimentary criticism, I’ll pepper
this story so full of atmosphere that folks will think they
are reading booster club’s literature about Florida.”</p>

<p>He could not do it. Consequently, I continue this story
in my own way, stating that if any more atmosphere is
in it, it got there by mistake. My plan is to turn it out so
that, from now on, not more than a page of it can be
skipped at one time and the rest of it make sense.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX. <br> The Cabin</h2>

<p>For three days, beginning with the fourth of July,
there was to be a big celebration and rodeo at Telko.
Trying to keep cowpunchers on the ranch, when there
was a celebration of any sort going on within a distance
of a couple of hundred miles, would be about as sensible
as trying to keep gunpowder in a hot oven. So all the
outfit that was on the ranch—never very many in July—were
tinkering with their flivvers, and currying their
mounts, and building up their boot-heels, and washing
and ironing, and making elaborate preparations to
attend.</p>

<p>Sam suggested at noon on the second of July, while
we were at dinner, that maybe all of us would like to go;
all, that is, except Martha and himself. Celebrations
were never good for Martha.</p>

<p>I spoke right up and said to count me out. I know the
deserts in July. But the boys were enthusiastic about
it, and Danny was interested. Gaby, coming in late,
greeted the idea with the same enthusiasm with which
a woman greets moths in the clothes closet.</p>

<p>“Whence the crave for a fourth of July celebration?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“We have never seen a rodeo,” Danny answered.</p>

<p>“Go, by all means,” Gaby said. “Buy pink lemonade.
March in the parade. Ride in the Liberty car. Mrs.
Magin would be stunning as the goddess of Liberty,
with——”</p>

<p>“Don’t let my stunningness stop anything,” I said.
“I am not going.”</p>

<p>“We’ll think it over,” Danny said. “It would be a long,
hot ride. Probably we should all have a pleasanter
time, right here at home.”</p>

<p>But there was something in the way she had said it,
too quickly in answer to a look from Gaby, that made
me think there was more to her backing out of the plan
than had appeared on the surface.</p>

<p>Gaby had just begun her dinner. The rest of us had
finished; so, according to our custom, we excused
ourselves and went our ways. Chad tried to stay with Gaby,
but Martha fussed and insisted that he come with her.</p>

<p>I had a sure feeling that Danny would return, and that
she and Gaby would have something to say to each other.
I went into the kitchen and told Belle to clean the stove.
Nothing made Belle so angry as to have to clean the
stove. The angrier she got, the more she clattered. When
I stepped back into the pass-pantry, and opened the
pass-window a crack, the kitchen sounded as if half a dozen
women were busy in it.</p>

<p>Just as I opened the window I heard John say, “I
thought Danny was in here.”</p>

<p>“No,” Gaby said. “But won’t you come in and talk
to me?”</p>

<p>“What about?”</p>

<p>“About—this.”</p>

<p>I dared not peek, so I did not know what she meant
until she said, “Why won’t you kiss me?”</p>

<p>“Shall I say, I don’t want to pick flowers in Hubert
Hand’s yard?”</p>

<p>“I hate you!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be sore at me, Gaby,” John said. “But I’m
telling you, that’s a lot nearer the truth than—than what
you usually say.”</p>

<p>John was one of the poorest talkers ever heard. One of
those strong, silent men supposed to abound in the west,
and who are likewise supposed to make every word that
they say count. If John’s did, they counted backwards.</p>

<p>“My dear, haven’t I proven over and over again that I
love you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know how.”</p>

<p>“In every way. I have made myself ridiculous, here, because
I haven’t been able to conceal my feelings for you.”</p>

<p>“I think,” John said, “that most of that stuff you pull
is just to spite Danny. It doesn’t spite her, though. She
knows she’s the only girl in the world for me. I wish you’d
cut it out—all of that, Gaby. Won’t you, and just be good
friends?”</p>

<p>“You’d not want me for an enemy, would you?”</p>

<p>“Getting at anything, going any place, Gaby?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps. If Danny should hear that you have made
love to me——”</p>

<p>“I have never made love to you. It would be your word
against mine. I think Danny would take mine, if it came
to a show-down.”</p>

<p>“You’d lie about it?”</p>

<p>“Gosh, no, Gaby. A lot worse than that. I’d tell the
truth about it. Listen here, child; don’t you try to make
trouble between Danny and me.”</p>

<p>“Meaning?”</p>

<p>“Nothing. Except that it wouldn’t be healthy for
anyone who tried it.”</p>

<p>“Boo‑oo! Dangerous Dan McGrew stuff? Out where
men are men? Killer loose to-night—all that, eh,
Johnnie?”</p>

<p>“Nothing like that,” he said, and his voice was so
gentle that if Gaby had been a puncher she would have
reached for her six-gun. “But killing would be too good
for the imaginary person we are talking about.”</p>

<p>A door opened. “John,” came in Danny’s voice,
“uncle is looking everywhere for you.”</p>

<p>“What,” Danny questioned, when the door had closed
behind John, “made you both look so angry, just now?”</p>

<p>“Nothing important. John had just threatened to kill
me, but——”</p>

<p>“Don’t be silly.”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Are you going to that fools’ celebration,
with only a day or two left, now?”</p>

<p>“I suppose not, if you don’t want me to. I’d love going.
I know there is no use in staying here.”</p>

<p>“In other words, you would sacrifice my future for a
rodeo?”</p>

<p>“That is silly.”</p>

<p>“Everything is always silly, with you. I more than half
believe that you know——”</p>

<p>“That’s sil—— I mean, what possible object could
I have?”</p>

<p>“Many, my dear. Very many. Though I think that
getting rid of me would outweigh the others.”</p>

<p>“Gaby, I don’t want to get rid of you. I wish you would
not be so silly, with John. But you know how eager I
was to get you away from the continent. I wish I knew
that you were going to stay right here for always.”</p>

<p>“Is that your game? Listen to me, Danielle Canneziano,
if I thought that you were keeping this from me,
in order to bury me alive in this God-forsaken hole, and
force me to watch you and John——”</p>

<p>“Gaby!”</p>

<p>“I’ve been a fool! Why can’t I learn to take into
consideration your damn moralities? Understand this, Dan.
Don’t fancy for one instant that failure is going to keep
me here. Did you think, with a weapon like that in my
hands, that I’d stand for anything less than a fifty-fifty
proposition? Our original plan would have been
better—easier, simpler. But I’ll have my share out of this,
anyway. So, if you do know——”</p>

<p>“Gaby, I don’t know. I’ll swear that I don’t.
How could I? But surely you wouldn’t—wouldn’t
attempt——”</p>

<p>“That is for you to say, darling.”</p>

<p>Darling, as she said it then, was as wicked a word as I
had ever listened to.</p>

<p>“For me to say?”</p>

<p>“Give John to me. I’ve changed my mind. If you’ll
do that, I’ll stay right here, and settle down, and do an
imitation of a moral, model wife that would satisfy even
you.”</p>

<p>“Gaby, you speak as if John were a child’s toy, to be
passed about. I couldn’t give him to you, if I were willing
to.”</p>

<p>“You could, and you know it. You won’t. So, that’s
that. But keep your righteous fingers out of my life;
stop your damn preaching, and meddling. I am going
to the cabin now. You would better come with me.”</p>

<p>“We’ve searched that cabin a thousand times.”</p>

<p>“All the same, it is the one logical place; far removed,
and under cover. Too, I must see whether that Indian
nailed those floor boards down again, before I pay him.”</p>

<p>The cabin is the one Sam built to live in when he first
came to the valley. It is up Boulder Creek, about half
a mile from the ranch-house, and, built in a big grove
of aspen trees, it is one of the prettiest spots on the place.
Sam has kept it in repair, inside and out; owing, I think,
to sentimental memories, though he declares it is because
he dislikes wreckage on the place. The best fishing on the
creek begins just above there; so the men, as a rule, leave
their fishing paraphernalia in the cabin’s kitchen. That
is the only use the place has been put to, since John and
Martha were little things, and Sam used to hide their
Christmas presents up there, under the shelf in the
kitchen.</p>

<p>The shelf, about three feet wide, is built across one end
of the kitchen. It served Sam for a table, pantry, and sink.
Being a man, he built it right handily, like a chest, so
that the entire top of it had to be raised to get to the
storage place underneath. There was no secret about it.
All anyone had to do, was to move everything off the top
of it, and lift the lid. But I had read how the hardest
problems for detectives always turned out to be something
that had been too simple to notice; so my plan was
to go up there and raise the lid.</p>

<p>On my way, I met the girls coming home. I imagined
that they looked at me with suspicion. I passed a remark
about the sweet-smelling clover hay, and hurried right
along.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, when I was expecting instant death
at any minute, I thought about that sweet clover smell,
and how unappreciative I have been of it, and of the blue
sky and fresh air, and of the green things, lighted yellow
with sunshine, and I took a vow that, if I ever did get a
chance to enjoy them again, I would spend the remainder
of my life in so doing, and in being grateful to the Creator
of them. The same as the last time I had a jumping toothache,
I thought that, if that tooth ever did stop aching,
nothing could ever make me unhappy again; I was going
to be peacefully happy, always, for the reason that I did
not have a toothache. Human nature, I have since
decided, is never happy because of negatives. At least,
I have never known anyone who was happy, for long,
because he did not have a toothache, or was not in a
hospital, or not hungry, or not—which brings me back to
my story—shut up in a chest with packages of explosives.</p>

<p>In the cabin, I went at once to the kitchen; and, removing
fish-baskets, fly-books, and reels from the shelf, lifted
it back.</p>

<p>I am sure that I had expected to find it empty. Perhaps
I had hoped to find a small iron box containing a
treasure, or a jewel-casket, or maybe an aged leather
case, containing the missing will, or the plans of some
secret fortification—any of the simple, ordinary things
generally hunted for and discovered. What I had not
expected to find, and what I certainly had never hoped to
find, was what was there: any number of neatly wrapped
packages, addressed to Mr. Sam Stanley, sent by express,
and labeled, variously, “Danger.” “Explosives.”
“Handle with Care.”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch10">

<h2>CHAPTER X. <br> A Conversation</h2>

<p>I am not claiming that I possessed one particle of
common sense at that minute, nor for a good many
minutes after that. My actions would give the lie, direct,
to any such assertion on my part. It did not take any
common sense to know, straight off, that, sent to him or
not, Sam was not mixed up in any business that had to
do with explosives, bombs, and Bolshevism. It was easy
enough to remember, then, that Sam had not been to
Rattail for the past ten days; that Hubert Hand had been
making the trips down for the mail, expressage, and
supplies.</p>

<p>Just as he came into my mind, I heard his voice. It
was a startling coincidence; but I need a better excuse
than that, for surely no mortal ever did a more foolish
thing than I did then. I climbed into that chest, along
with those packages, and lowered the lid down over me.
If I had any idea, I suppose it must have been a desire
not to let him know that I had discovered his
secret—his and Gaby’s together, undoubtedly—but I can’t
remember having any thought at all until, just as the lid
closed, I remembered the sad poem about the bride and
the mistletoe chest.</p>

<p>I thought, then, that her situation was comfortable
compared to mine. If you have never been packed in a
box with a lot of explosives, as I hope you have not,
you can have no notion of what I went through. I could
have climbed out. But, if you are an elderly woman, of
my size and build, as I hope you are not, and if you have
a certain reputation for dignity to live up to, and a
certain reputation for snooping to live down, you can have
an idea why I didn’t come springing out of there, like a
jack-in-the-box, or like the immoral ladies who emerge
from pies—so the papers say—at bachelor’s parties.
I weighed the matter carefully, as I heard, through the
thin boards, Hubert Hand, talking to someone, come into
the kitchen. I chose death by suffocation or combustion.</p>

<p>“My dear woman,” were the first words I heard from
him, “you may set your mind at rest. I am not going to
marry the girl. I am not a marrying man, as you know;
and, if I were, she wouldn’t have me.”</p>

<p>“You leave her alone, then. Understand me. Leave her
alone.”</p>

<p>If I believed my ears, that was Mrs. Ricker’s voice;
that was Mrs. Ricker, not only talking, but talking like
that to Hubert Hand.</p>

<p>“You flatter me,” he said. “Jealous, still, after all these
years?”</p>

<p>“I despise you. But you leave that girl alone. If you
think I’ll stand, silent, and allow you to marry her——”</p>

<p>“Hire a hall. I told you that I wouldn’t marry her, and
that she wouldn’t have me, if I were willing to.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t she, though? Wouldn’t she? She is mad
about you. She can’t look at you without love in her
eyes, nor speak to you without love in her voice. She tries
to hide it; but she can’t hide it from me. I know. She
loves you.”</p>

<p>I am not sure whether I read it, or whether I figured
it out for myself; but I do know it is a fact that no
woman ever accuses another woman of being in love with
a man unless she could imagine being in love with him
herself.</p>

<p>“As to that,” Hubert Hand said, in that preeny,
offhand manner that men, who will discuss their love
affairs at all, use when discussing them, “what possible
difference could it make to you, Ollie?”</p>

<p>“Only that I would kill her, and you, too, before I
would let her have you.”</p>

<p>“Easy on there, my girl. Your last attempt at murder—at
least I hope that was your last attempt—was not,
you may recall, very successful.”</p>

<p>“I would be successful another time.”</p>

<p>I clamped my teeth to keep them from chattering. I
wished that I had some way as easy for muffling the
sound made by the pounding of my heart, which was
thudding away as loudly as a butter churn in rapid
action. Except for that I kept quiet; very quiet.
Surrounded, in there by explosives, and out there by people
who talked of murder as calmly and as comfortably as if
they were discussing moss-roses, very quiet did not seem
half quiet enough.</p>

<p>They went into the other room of the cabin and stayed
there for a few minutes. I could not hear what they were
saying, but I did not budge an inch. After I heard them
passing the window, and was sure that they had left the
cabin, I remained, very quiet, in the chest for about five
minutes longer before climbing out of it.</p>

<p>I was progressing toward home, shivering in every
bone, limping, since both my legs had gone to sleep, when
Sam, riding his bad tempered bronco named Wishbone,
came up behind me and dismounted.</p>

<p>“Corns bad, Mary?” he questioned. “Must be going
to have rain.”</p>

<p>“Keep water in the ditches. Both my feet are asleep,
from the ankles up.”</p>

<p>“Upon my soul! First time in history you ever sat still
in one place long enough to have that happen. Well, well.
‘Do the thing that’s nearest.’ Want to climb up on
Wishbone and have me lead him?”</p>

<p>“When I go to meet death,” I told him, “I shan’t
go on the back of a nasty tempered bronco.”</p>

<p>“Speaking of tempers,” Sam grinned, “a person would
think I had sung your feet to sleep, Mary.”</p>

<p>“Considering,” I replied, “that everyone on the
Desert Moon is, at this minute, in mortal danger of their
lives, all your lighthearted jesting seems pretty much out
of place.”</p>

<p>I told him, then, about the packages of explosives
hidden under the shelf. I had not told him about my
climbing in with them; so I was in no way prepared for
his actions.</p>

<p>He stopped. He dropped Wishbone’s bridle. He put
both his hands on his stomach and leaned over and burst
into uproarious laughter. “Ho-ho-ho,” it rolled out,
seeming to fill the entire valley. He leaned to one side; he
leaned to the other side, and kept on laughing to deafen
the far distant deserts.</p>

<p>“Fireworks,” he gasped. “I got them for Martha.
Going to surprise her on the fourth. Sent for them months
ago. Hid them up there. Ho-ho-ho! I told you to stop
pussy-footing around, Mary. Ho-ho-ho! ‘Do not look
for wrong and evil, you will find them if you do——’ ”</p>

<p>With as much dignity as a heavy woman, with both
of her legs asleep, could muster, I turned and left him.
His words and his actions had certainly given me one
decision. From this time on, I would tell Sam Stanley
nothing.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI. <br> The Letter</h2>

<p>When I got back to the house, John was driving
up the road in the sedan. He had been to Rattail
for supplies and for the mail. He tossed the mailbag out
to me, and drove around to the kitchen door to unload.</p>

<p>As a rule the Desert Moon mail is mighty uninteresting,
being made up, almost entirely, of bills and advertising
matter. Since the girls had come, a few sleazy,
foreign looking letters had livened it up a bit. To a person
who has never been farther east than Salt Lake City, a
letter from England, or from France, does carry quite a
thrill with it. There was a letter for Gaby to-day,
postmarked France.</p>

<p>About a month before this, Gaby had received another
letter that was a duplicate of this one; the same gray
paper, the same sprawling handwriting. Instead of taking
it indifferently, as she did other letters, and reading it
wherever she happened to be, she had snatched it out
of my hand and had run off to her room. All that
evening she had seemed to be preoccupied, and worried.
The writing looked like a man’s writing; but, like a lot of
other things, including cigarette smoke, hip pockets and
hair cuts, it is not as easy as it used to be to distinguish
between male and female in handwriting, at a distance.
Sending only two letters in close to two months, it
seemed to me that whoever had written them did not
write unless he or she had something of importance to
say. I was still puzzling over it, when Gaby came into
the room.</p>

<p>Sure enough, she snatched it out of my hands, just as
she had done with the other letter, and ran straight
upstairs with it.</p>

<p>When John and Danny came in, a few minutes later,
I went upstairs. Habit stopped me at Gaby’s door for a
minute, with my ear to the keyhole. Faintly, sounds
don’t come plainly through our thick doors, I heard the
portable typewriter that she had brought with her when
she came to the ranch, click, clicking away.</p>

<p>My first judgment was that she was not losing any time
in answering that letter; but, as I went down the hall,
I had a hazy notion that there had been something queer,
different, about the way she had been using the machine.
Instead of snapping away on it, lickety-split, as she
usually did, she had been touching the keys slowly and
carefully, picking them out one at a time, the way I have
to do when I try to use Sam’s plaguey machine to copy
recipes for my card catalog.</p>

<p>I was tuckered and tired. So, after telephoning some
instructions to Belle and Sadie in the kitchen, I took
plenty of time to tidy myself up. I dawdled in my bath,
and I cut my corns, and rubbed hair tonic into my scalp.
But, when on my way downstairs again, I stopped for a
second at Gaby’s door, the typewriter was still going,
with its slow click, click. There was nothing to be made
out of it, so I went along. It was fortunate that I did,
because, before I had reached the top of the stairway,
Gaby’s door flung open and she called to me, with
something in her voice that made me shake in my shoes.</p>

<p>I turned and looked at her. Her face wore an expression
that was not human; an expression that would have made
any decent woman do as I did, and turn her eyes quickly
away.</p>

<p>“Tell Danny to come up here,” she said.</p>

<p>I hurried off downstairs, and delivered the message
to Danny who was with John in the living-room.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter, Mary?” John questioned, when
Danny had gone upstairs. “You look as if you had seen a
ghost.”</p>

<p>“I think,” I answered, “that I have—the ghost of
Sin.”</p>

<p>“Doggone that girl,” he said. “I wish she were in
Jericho.”</p>

<p>“Gaby, you mean?”</p>

<p>“You’re darn right. She’s causing all the trouble
around here.”</p>

<p>“What trouble?” I asked, just for a feeler.</p>

<p>“I don’t know—exactly. She keeps Danny miserable.
But that isn’t it, or not all of it. Don’t you seem to feel
trouble around here, all the time? I thought everyone
did. I do, Gosh knows.”</p>

<p>“I know,” I said. “I feel it, too. I think Sam does,
though he won’t altogether admit it. Just the same, John,
there isn’t a thing we can put our fingers on, is there?”</p>

<p>He walked to the window and looked out at the long
range of Garnet Mountains, turning blood-red, now,
under the sunset.</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” he said, at last. “Sometimes, though,
when I see Danny looking as she looked when she went
upstairs just now, I feel as if it would be a good thing
if somebody would put their fingers around that vixen’s
throat.”</p>

<p>“John,” I spoke sharply to him, “don’t say things like
that. You don’t mean it. It is wrong to say it.”</p>

<p>I was sure that he did not mean it. I was sure that
only the voice of one of his rare ugly moods had spoken,
and that the wicked thought had died with the wicked
words. But, from that day to this, I have never repeated
those words to a living soul. Because that was the way
that Gaby was murdered: choked to death, with great
brutal bruises left on her throat.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII. <br> An Insight</h2>

<p>In spite of all my efforts not to do so, I have, again,
run on ahead of the story. But, I declare to Goodness,
the horror of it, after all these months, is still so strong
upon me, that I know the only way to get that written
is to write it, with no more dilly-dally, and then to go
back and lead up to it properly with the events that
immediately preceded it.</p>

<p>That evening, then, the second of July, the two girls
came down, late, together. Danny was paler than usual,
and her face had a drawn, hurt look, which she explained
by saying that she had a severe headache. Gaby was
gayer than gay.</p>

<p>I kept watching her, trying to catch her face in repose,
to see if any trace remained of that dreadful expression
I had seen in the afternoon. Her face, nor one bit of her,
was in repose for a minute from the time she came downstairs
until she went upstairs again, after twelve o’clock
that night.</p>

<p>She put “La Paloma” on the phonograph, and did a
Spanish dance, clicking her heels and snapping her fingers
until they sounded like firecrackers. She did an Egyptian
dance, slinking about, and contortioning. It wasn’t
decent. She got the whole crowd, including the girls
from the kitchen (who had stayed to gape through the
door at her dancing, instead of going home as they
should have gone), and excluding only Danny, with her
headache, Mrs. Ricker and me, to join in a game of follow
the leader, and she led them a wild chase all over the
house from cellar to attic. Laughing, and jumping, and
screaming, and shouting they went, with the radio shrieking
out the jazz orchestra in Los Angeles; and me with
depression so heavy upon me that it felt real, like
indigestion.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker was doing some tatting. As I watched her,
I decided that, ears or no ears, she was not the woman I
had heard talking, that afternoon, up in the cabin.
Hubert Hand had said to that woman that she had
attempted murder. She could not have been Mrs. Ricker,
not our Mrs. Ricker, the thin, silent woman who had
lived so decently with us for so long. Those white, bony
fingers, darting the shuttle back and forth, making
edgings for handkerchiefs, had never held any murderous
weapon. Those tight, wrinkled lips had never said, “I
would kill her, and you too.” John had never said—I
shivered. It was fanciful thinking, but it seemed to me
that for years the Desert Moon had ridden in our sky,
clean and clear, a lucky, fair weather moon, and that now
the shadow of the wicked world was slowly creeping over
it, inch by inch, with the darkness that was to end in its
eclipse. Wicked thoughts and wicked words breed wicked
actions, and I knew it then as now.</p>

<p>Martha came crying to Mrs. Ricker. “Gaby hurt
Chad,” she said. “I wish she would die. We could make
her a nice funeral.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker’s fingers darted faster, back and forth.</p>

<p>Danny spoke, from the davenport. “You shouldn’t
talk like that, Martha, dear. It is wrong.”</p>

<p>Her voice sounded as if it ached. She looked, lying in a
huddle over there, as miserable as I felt. I was drawn to
her. I went and sat beside her.</p>

<p>“Could I do anything for your headache?” I asked.
“Get you some asperin, maybe.”</p>

<p>“No, thank you, Mary.” There was so much gratitude
in her big dark eyes for nothing but common decency
on my part, that I felt downright ashamed of myself.</p>

<p>“Danny,” I said, straight out, never caring much
about mincing words, “I know that something is troubling
you. Why don’t you tell John, or Sam, or even me
about it? Just tell us the truth. We’d all go far to help
you, if we could.”</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears. “Bless your heart, Mary,”
she said. “Bless all of your hearts. You are all so good,
here——”</p>

<p>I was enough annoyed with John for coming up right
then, to have slapped him. I answered his question for
Danny.</p>

<p>“There is plenty you could do for her,” I said. “You
could shut off that screeching radio, for one thing. And
you could quiet down, and get the others quieted down.
Nobody ever told me that noise like this was a remedy
for a splitting headache; did they you?”</p>

<p>“The dickens! By Gollies! It is a wonder you wouldn’t
have told me before, Mary.” Man fashion, putting the
blame on me.</p>

<p>Danny wouldn’t hear to John’s stopping the racket.
Everyone was having such a good time. Bed was the
place for her. She couldn’t hear any noise in her room,
with the door shut. And off she went.</p>

<p>I know now that she would not have told me anything
that could have helped matters. But I did not know it
then, and I was sorely disappointed. For those sudden
tears in her eyes, and her voice when she had said, “bless
your heart,” had convinced me that there was sincerity
behind them, and honesty, and good.</p>

<p>In the black days that followed, when all of us were
living in the dark shadows of doubts, and confusions,
and fears and suspicions, I was thankful, time and again,
for those certainties, for that one fleeting but sure insight
into Danny’s soul.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII. <br> The Quarrel</h2>

<p>The morning of the third was biting hot, with that
stinging, piercing heat that we have, when we have
heat at all, in this high altitude. The sixty mile trip
across the deserts to Telko, on a day like this, would be
exactly the same as a sixty mile trip through an oven
at the right heat for a roast of beef.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, before seven o’clock that morning, every
man-jack of a puncher on the place, with all of his
trimmings and trappings, including wives, squaws, papooses,
children and firearms, had set off in flivvers or on
horseback, bound for the celebration, leaving the place
hole-empty, as Sam said, when he came into my kitchen with
a gallon of cream from the dairy.</p>

<p>He pulled the stool out from under the table, perched
on it, and remarked, as cheerfully as if he were reading it
off a tombstone, “ ‘Sufficient unto the day is the evil
thereof.’ ”</p>

<p>I didn’t want him bothering me in the kitchen, when I
had everything to do, with Belle, Sadie and Goldie gone
gadding; but being a woman, normal I hope, I asked him
what he meant by that.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to be surprised,” he answered, “if we
have another visitor, one of these days.”</p>

<p>“Nor me either,” I said, though much astonished,
because it was as if he had read my mind. At that minute
I had been worrying about Sadie. She was expecting her
baby, before long, and Land only knew what such a trip
as she was off taking now, and the celebration to boot,
might precipitate. “That fool girl,” I went on. “It
wouldn’t surprise me a bit if this was the death of
her—not a bit.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw!” Sam said. “What have you found out,
Mary?”</p>

<p>“She told me herself, the last of July.”</p>

<p>“Yes? I thought all along that she knew.”</p>

<p>Since he seemed as sober as an owl, and as serious, I
decided that there was no answer to make, and I made
none.</p>

<p>“She’s off a few weeks, though. I sent a telegram, and
got an answer yesterday. It is the fourth of July.”</p>

<p>“Sam,” I found breath to retort, “one of us is plumb
crazy. I think it is you. Do you think it is me?”</p>

<p>“Not to make any bones about it,” Sam said, “I have
thought, here lately, that every dang soul on the place
was only saved from being in the asylum because of the
ignorance of the authorities. But, in this case, I think
I am sane and certain. I wired the warden of the
penitentiary. He said that Daniel Canneziano was to be
released on the morning of the fourth of July. Gaby told
you the last of July? Probably some time off, for good
behavior.”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t talking about Canneziano,” I snapped.
“And how did I know you were? I was talking about
Sadie’s baby.”</p>

<p>I dropped into a chair, feeling sort of weakened from
the news about Canneziano, and waited with what
patience I could for Sam to stop laughing.</p>

<p>“You mark my words,” I said, when the laugh had
gone down to a silly giggle, over which I could make
myself heard, “all these queer actions around here have
something to do with that man’s release.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you,” Sam said. “But blame my soul if I know
what to do, about anything.”</p>

<p>“I know what I’d do about Canneziano, if he shows up
here,” I told him.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But he is Danny’s father, and Danny is
going to marry John. After all, money is not much good
unless you take it to market. If I could come to a decent
agreement with the fellow—— And if he’d take that
Gaby with him. I’m dead certain that her hanging around
here isn’t going to contribute any to John’s and Danny’s
married life——”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, Sam?” Gaby asked the
question, walking right into the kitchen. I was all taken
aback; but Sam didn’t seem to be.</p>

<p>“Eavesdroppers, my girl,” he said, “hear no good of
themselves. I mean that I don’t think any girl who
wanted to act right would treat her sister’s betrothed as
you treat John.”</p>

<p>“You,” she said, very slowly, to make insult baste
each word, “are a damned old fool, Sam Stanley.”</p>

<p>I shook in my shoes. I had not dreamed that there was
a living human being who would dare say that, in that
tone of voice, to Sam.</p>

<p>He stood up. He put his hands on her shoulders, gently
though, and turned her around.</p>

<p>“You are a bad, wayward girl,” he said. “March out
of here, now, and get your manners mended before I see
you again.”</p>

<p>He sobered even her, for a minute. She walked to the
door, without another word. There, she whirled around
like a crazy thing, and, I declare to Goodness, I don’t
know what she said. It was the sort of talking I had never
heard in my life; my ears were not enough accustomed
to the words to take in their meanings. But one thing
that she kept screaming, screaming so loudly that she
could be heard all over the place, was that Sam had
threatened her once too often. Sam stood there, paralyzed,
I think, as I was, for perhaps a couple of minutes,
before he turned and walked off, into the backyard.</p>

<p>Hubert Hand came rushing in. Gaby threw her arms
around his neck, and kept on with the screaming and
sobbing. Chad came in through the pantry. Mrs. Ricker
opened the door that was at the foot of the back
stairway.</p>

<p>She stood there, in the doorway, watching Hubert
Hand, with both his arms around Gaby, petting and
soothing her. She dampened her tight lips with her
tongue; but, without saying a word, she went back up the
stairs, closing the door behind her. Hubert Hand led
Gaby into the dining-room, and through it into the
living-room.</p>

<p>“What in God’s name happened?” Chad said to me.</p>

<p>I went and washed my face and took a drink of water.
“Chad,” I said, “Gabrielle Canneziano has lost her
mind. She is insane.”</p>

<p>His face went white as lard. “I don’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Either that,” I said, “or else she is the wickedest,
the——”</p>

<p>“Stop it,” he shouted at me. “You, nor anyone, can
talk to me like that about the girl I love.”</p>

<p>“Love! Love your foot!” I snapped at him. The idea
of mooning about love to me, at a time like that.</p>

<p>“None of you understands her,” he said, “nor tries
to. She is in some sort of trouble—terrible trouble.
Anyone can see that. I’d give my soul to help her—— To
serve her——”</p>

<p>“If you are so crazy about serving her,” I said, “you
might go into the dining-room and set the table, and help
me serve her, and the rest of you, some breakfast.”</p>

<p>He went into the yard. Like a lot of men, I thought,
who want to give their souls and so on to women, he
didn’t care to be bothered with smaller details, such as
feeding them.</p>

<p>I wronged him. Whether or not a man has the giving
of his soul, in his own hands, I do not know. A man can
give his life. That is what Chad gave.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch14">

<h2>CHAPTER XIV. <br> Two Departures</h2>

<p>After dinner, which we didn’t have until nearly one
o’clock on the fourth of July, owing to Chad’s not
getting the ice-cream frozen on time, John surprised us all
by saying that he was going to take the sedan and drive
down to Rattail for the mail.</p>

<p>I suspicioned, right then, that he was up to something.
He could not fool me into thinking that he would take a
fifty mile trip—twenty-five miles each way—through the
desert heat for no other reason than to get the mail. He
couldn’t do any trading, since all of Rattail would be off
to the Telko celebration. When Danny seemed hurt and
troubled about him going, and when he went riding right
off, anyway, I decided that Sam must have sent him,
expecting some word concerning Canneziano. I was
wrong.</p>

<p>We had had a stiff breeze, with a promising sprinkle of
rain in the morning; but it had died down about noon
and, at two o’clock, it was too tarnation hot to do
anything but try to keep cool. I stacked the dinner dishes,
to wash in the evening, and joined the others, sitting
around in the living-room with the electric fans going full
blast.</p>

<p>Sam, chess board in hand, stopped long enough by
my chair to say in an undertone, “What did I tell you,
Mary? ‘It is always darkest, just before the dawn.’ ”</p>

<p>That piece of optimism from him was due, in part, to
the extra good holiday dinner he had just eaten; and in
part to a sense of quiet, edging close to peace, that had
pervaded the place since morning. I had noticed it, too,
with thankfulness, and had accounted for it with the
supposition that Gaby had spent all of her energy in
meanness the day before, and was obliged to rest up for a
spell.</p>

<p>“That’s a nice little piece,” I answered Sam. “There
is another one, though, isn’t there, about a lull before
the storm?”</p>

<p>That was not pure contrariness on my part. I was
expecting, every minute, to see Gaby break out again.
She didn’t. She yawned around, and fussed about, and
then went and sat beside Danny, who was looking at the
pictures in <i>The Ladies Home Journal</i>, and put her arm
around her, and petted her up a little—a most unusual
performance for her.</p>

<p>When Chad, who had been monkeying with the radio,
got a rip-roaring patriotic program from Salt Lake, the
two girls went upstairs together.</p>

<p>A few minutes later I had an errand upstairs—a real
one, I wouldn’t have taken myself up in that heat to
satisfy any curiosity—so, out of habit, I stopped at
Gaby’s door to listen. I heard the girls giggling in there;
and, knowing no great harm is afoot when girls giggle, I
went on, got my scrap of pongee silk to mend Sam’s
shirt, and came downstairs again.</p>

<p>Sam and Hubert Hand were deep in their chess game.
Mrs. Ricker was tatting. Chad and Martha were playing
dots and crosses. In spite of the noise from the radio,
there was a comfortable feeling about the room that made
me lonesome for the days we had all had together before
the Canneziano girls had come.</p>

<p>The radio program, which was to last from two until
four o’clock, had just that minute stopped. Martha, who
when she didn’t forget it, usually fed her rabbits about
that time of day, had gone out to do it. Gaby came
downstairs, humming a tune.</p>

<p>She had on the tomato soup colored wrap that she had
worn on the train, and the hat to match the wrap. She
was carrying a beaded bag. She never dressed up like
that, to go walking around the place; a wrap, even such
a light one, in the heat of that day, was downright
ridiculous.</p>

<p>Chad said, “All dressed up and no place to go?”</p>

<p>She tossed her head at him, and hurried straight down
the room and out through the glass doors. Chad followed
her. They stopped together on the porch. She stood with
her back to me. Chad faced me. In a minute, I saw his
mouth bend up into a grin of bliss. Nothing would have
surprised me more. For this reason.</p>

<p>As that girl had walked through the room, I had seen
that she walked in mortal fear. In spite of her humming,
in spite of her attempted swagger, fear was in her widened
eyes, in her drawn in chin, in the contraction of her
shoulders. Wherever it was that she was going, she was
afraid to go. But where could she go? John had the
sedan. Except for the trucks, which she couldn’t drive,
and her pony—she surely would not be dressed like that
to ride horseback—there was no way for her to get off
the place. It must be, then, that someone was coming to
the place, and that she was going out alone to meet them.
Who? Canneziano? Not unless Sam had been mistaken
about the time when he was to be released from prison.
Usually, when people think at all, they think quickly.
All this had gone through my mind while she had walked
the forty feet to the door. Before Chad smiled, I had
spoken to Mrs. Ricker.</p>

<p>“That girl,” I said, “is afraid of something.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker darted her tatting shuttle back and forth.
She moistened her lips, with her tongue; but changed her
mind and said nothing.</p>

<p>Gaby and Chad stood on the porch talking for two or
three minutes—a very short time, at any rate. Then she
went down the steps, and Chad, still smiling, came back
into the room.</p>

<p>As he came in, Danny called down from the top of the
stairway. “Gaby—oh, Gaby?”</p>

<p>She knows where Gaby is going, and whom she is going
to meet, and she, too, is afraid, I decided, because of the
queer, strained quality of her voice.</p>

<p>“Gaby has gone out,” I called, in answer. And then,
since I could still see Gaby, walking down the path, “Do
you want her, Danny? We could fetch her back.”</p>

<p>“No,” Danny answered. “Don’t bother. I’ll come
down.”</p>

<p>I had to reverse my first decision about Danny’s being
frightened. At least, her voice was natural enough, now;
I fancied, perhaps, a note of relief in it.</p>

<p>It couldn’t have been more than ten minutes after
that, when Martha came running into the house, laughing
and dancing, and wearing the gold bracelet with the
monkey clasp. Gaby, she said, had given it to her, just
now, out by the rabbit hutch.</p>

<p>While we were all still exclaiming over the monkey,
and praising it up, to please Martha, Danny came
downstairs. She was freshly dressed, and sweet smelling with
the nice, quiet flower scent she used, but she looked
really ill. She said her headache was worse again, and
she drew the curtains at the windows beside the big
davenport, to ease the glare of the light, before she curled
up on it.</p>

<p>I thought it was a good time to continue the
conversation we had begun the other evening.</p>

<p>“Danny,” I said, as I sat down beside her, “if you
just could tell John, or Sam, or me what is troubling you,
I am pretty sure that we could find some way out.”</p>

<p>“Bless your hearts,” she repeated. “You are all too
good. I am afraid I can’t tell you what has been troubling
me. But I can tell you, honestly, that I think now the
worst of the troubles are over. They never were really
mine, you see; they were Gaby’s. And now Gaby has
decided to—well, stop being troubled.</p>

<p>“We had a good long talk this afternoon. She has
made me some promises. She is going to try to act
differently, to be good—as she used to say when we were
little. She had a dreadful disappointment day before
yesterday. It made her act very badly—at first. She has
decided now to make the best of it, for there is a best of it
to make. You’ve noticed how much better she acted last
evening and all of to-day? She is making a fresh start.
You see, she has even given Martha her precious monkey.
I am sure we shall all be much happier, from now on.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where she was going this afternoon?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“For a little walk.”</p>

<p>“Why did she wear her wrap, and carry her beaded
bag, just to go out for a little walk?”</p>

<p>Danny sat up straight, pressing her hands to her aching
head. “Her wrap—to-day? Her beaded bag? Surely not.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what she did. Didn’t you see her before
she left?”</p>

<p>“I was lying down. She came to my door and said that
she was going for a walk, and asked me if I cared to go
with her. I said that my headache was too severe. She
went into her room, and from there downstairs. I felt
guilty about refusing to go with her, after our talk. I
thought that I should; so I called after her. But, when
you said she had gone, I was afraid she would be annoyed
at being called back. I had gotten up; so, since John will
surely be home before long, now, I came down. I can’t
understand her wearing a wrap. It is so silly, on a day like
this.”</p>

<p>It sounded all right, but I was not quite satisfied.</p>

<p>“I thought,” I said, “that, when you called after her,
you were frightened, or worried, or—something.”</p>

<p>“Frightened? No, Mary, I had nothing to be
frightened about.”</p>

<p>“Gaby was frightened,” I said.</p>

<p>“Gaby! She couldn’t have been. She was all right this
afternoon. Nothing could have happened since then.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Something was the matter with her
when she walked through this room. I’ll go bond that,
wherever it was she was going, she was afraid to go.”</p>

<p>“Mary, it must be that you are imagining this. Unless—Oh,
it couldn’t be that Gaby has not told me the truth
about—about anything. I am sure she was honest with
me this afternoon. I am sure—— And yet—— Dear me,
I wonder where she went for her walk?”</p>

<p>“She talked to Chad, just before she left. Maybe she
told him where she was going.”</p>

<p>Danny called the question across the room to Chad,
who was improvising cheerful, happy music on the
piano.</p>

<p>“Not a word,” Chad spoke above his music, “except
that she was going for a walk and didn’t want my
company.”</p>

<p>“Gaby told me,” Martha piped up, from where she
was sitting on the arm of Sam’s chair, “that she was
going to the cabin. She was in a big hurry. She ran.”</p>

<p>“Up toward the cabin?” Danny questioned, though we
all knew we could not put a mite of trust in anything
Martha said.</p>

<p>“Yes. Chad loves me better’n he loves her. Don’t you,
Chad?”</p>

<p>“You are positive,” Danny insisted, and I couldn’t see
why, for a minute, “that she went to the cabin, or
toward it? You aren’t fibbing, are you, Martha dear?
Are you sure that she didn’t go around the house toward
the road?”</p>

<p>When she asked about the road, her meaning was clear
to me. Danny was afraid that Gaby had gone to meet
John, who should have been back from Rattail before
this. But, if she had hoped to get anything out of Martha,
she had made a mistake in her questioning. For anyone
to accuse Martha of a fib, was to make her stick to it
like a waffle to an ungreased pan.</p>

<p>“She told me she was going to the cabin,” Martha
answered. “She ran. She was in a hurry.”</p>

<p>Danny stood up. “I think I shall walk up to the cabin
and see whether I can find her. You’ll come with me,
Mary?”</p>

<p>I said not in the heat. Besides, it would soon be five
o’clock, and time to be starting supper. She asked Mrs.
Ricker to go with her. Mrs. Ricker refused. I wondered
why, when neither of us would go, Danny did not go by
herself. She did not. Had she, perhaps, guessed at the
cause of Gaby’s fear? Did she share it? Was she afraid to
go to the cabin alone?</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch15">

<h2>CHAPTER XV. <br> One Return</h2>

<p>At five o’clock the men put up the chess board.
Chad stopped playing the piano, and the three of
them went to the barns together.</p>

<p>I went into the kitchen to get supper. Danny, in spite of
her headache, insisted upon helping me. She did the best
she could. She managed to get the table set, in between
times when she was not running to the window to see
whether John was coming.</p>

<p>At six o’clock, though neither John nor Gaby had
returned, we sat down to supper. Danny was too nervous
to touch a bit of food. She kept looking out of the
windows, and at her watch, and out of the windows again.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Danny,” Sam said. “John has had tire
trouble, on account of the heat. They’ll come riding up
the road any minute now.”</p>

<p>“They?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“Gaby togged up and went down the road to meet
John, didn’t she?”</p>

<p>“No,” Danny’s voice curled into a wail. “No, Uncle
Sam, she didn’t. Martha saw her going to the cabin.
Didn’t you, Martha?”</p>

<p>“Martha,” Mrs. Ricker astonished us all by saying,
“doesn’t know where Gaby went. She knows only where
Gaby told her she was going.”</p>

<p>“But why should Gaby tell her a fib about it?” Danny
asked.</p>

<p>“And why,” I questioned, “should Gaby go around the
house to get to the road, instead of going right out the
front way?”</p>

<p>Again Mrs. Ricker shocked us by speaking. “She
would not go out the front way, if she wanted to keep her
trip to the road a secret.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ricker,” Danny’s voice trembled, “What are
you hinting? What is it that you know?”</p>

<p>“I know,” said Mrs. Ricker, “that there is not a man
living who is not as false as sin.”</p>

<p>Sam growled, “Come down to facts, Mrs. Ricker, if
you have any.”</p>

<p>I think it was the first time Sam had ever spoken
unpleasantly to her. He betrayed his own anxiety by so
doing. It was easy to see that she was cut to the quick.</p>

<p>“I have no facts,” she said, “except, that right after
dinner to-day John and Gaby had a private conversation,
and he decided, very suddenly, to go for the mail.”</p>

<p>At that minute we heard a sound for sore ears—the
car coming up the driveway. Danny jumped up and ran
to look out of the living-room window. “He has gone
all the way around to the kitchen,” she said, when she
came back. If it had not been sort of pathetic, showing
how worried she had been, her impatience at having to
wait another minute or so to see him, would have been
funny.</p>

<p>She ran into the kitchen. She and John came to the
door of the butler’s pantry. John was gray with dust. His
brows were knitted, as they are whenever he is troubled
about anything.</p>

<p>“He hasn’t seen Gaby,” Danny announced, with an
exultation that showed plainly what she had been most
anxious about. “He brought up the rock-salt. That’s why
he drove to the kitchen. Come and see, Mary?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather see you two come and eat your suppers,”
I said.</p>

<p>“Goodnight!” John answered. “I’ve got to go and get
rid of a few tons of dirt before I can come to the table.”</p>

<p>“No,” Danny insisted. “Never mind the dirt, dear.
Supper is all cold now. Please come and eat——”</p>

<p>John patted her on the shoulder, and smiled at her,
and, manlike, did as he pleased. He went through the
kitchen and upstairs the back way. Danny called after
him, asking him to hurry. He didn’t.</p>

<p>When he finally did come, all slicked up, and bathed
and shaved, he said it was too hot to eat, and would have
nothing but some ice-cream.</p>

<p>Sam asked him what had kept him so long, on the trip.
John said tire trouble; and that he had met Leo Saule,
two miles this side of Rattail, with his flivver broken
down. John had stopped to help him, and, at last, had
been forced to tow him the six miles north to his place.</p>

<p>John has a way, when he is worried, of shutting and
opening his eyes, and of tossing his head back and to the
side with a quick little jerk, as if he were trying to get
shed of something that was in it. All the while he was
eating and talking, he kept doing this. I asked him
whether his head ached.</p>

<p>“No,” he said. “But I think I’m sort of loco from
being out in the sun.”</p>

<p>“Gaby kept you waiting quite a while?” Hubert Hand
stated and asked.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” John questioned.</p>

<p>“Waited for her down the road, didn’t you, and took
her to Rattail in time to catch the train for Reno, or
’Frisco?”</p>

<p>I thought John would fly into a temper. He has a handy
temper. But he only looked around at all of us, with a
bewildered expression, and, “Say, are you fellows trying
to put something over on me, or what?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Then you don’t deny——” Hubert Hand began.
Sam, who has enough dander for John and himself both,
when necessary, broke in.</p>

<p>“John doesn’t have to deny anything. Marcus will be
in the office now, waiting for Twenty-one. ’Phone down.
’Phone’s handy. Ask him whether he flagged Twenty,
to-day, for a passenger, or whether he is going to flag
Twenty-one.”</p>

<p>Hubert went straight to the telephone. From his end
of the conversation, we could tell that Twenty had not
stopped, and that no one was waiting for Twenty-one.
He looked foolish, when he turned from the telephone,
and said, “Take it all back, John. My mistake.”</p>

<p>Sam looked mighty serious. “Well,” he drawled, “I
don’t know but what as good a plan as any would be for
us all to go out and have a look around for her——”</p>

<p>“Oh!” Danny exclaimed, sharply. “Uncle Sam, you do
think that she has met with some mishap?”</p>

<p>“I think,” Sam said, “that she has met with another
machine and ridden off in it. But, better safe than
sorry; then we’ll be fine and fit for the fireworks. Eh,
Martha?”</p>

<p>Martha, who had been drowsy all during supper, was
half asleep on the davenport, and did not answer.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch16">

<h2>CHAPTER XVI. <br> The Murder</h2>

<p>Sam’s first plan, after he and Hubert had made a
quick ride to the cabin and back with no sight of
Gaby, was for the two of us to go down the road in the
sedan. Fortunately, he decided at the last minute to
have John come with us to drive. Danny came along
with John. Chad and Hubert Hand were to scout around
the place on their ponies. Mrs. Ricker stayed at home
with Martha.</p>

<p>As soon as we had started, Sam said, in a cocksure,
overbearing way he never has except when he is not as
certain of himself as he’d like to be, “We’ll not have to go
far. Not more than a mile, I reckon, to find the fresh tire
tracks of the machine that came up here to meet her.
After the breeze and the shower this morning, the fresh
tracks will show up like mud on a new fence. Whoa! What
did I tell you? See there.”</p>

<p>Tire tracks, sure enough; but they were the tracks
made by the sedan, patterned like a snake’s back, and
showing, plain as print, on top of the dim tracks made by
the outfit’s departure for Telko the morning before. We
rode along, watching the four long trails; two for John’s
trip to town, and two for his trip back to the ranch. The
only breaks were the spots where, as it was plain to be
seen, John had twice had tire trouble.</p>

<p>Our road—and it is that, since Sam had it graded himself,
and pays for having it kept up—runs north, straight
as a string, with Sam’s fields and fences on one side of it,
and sagebrush covered deserts on the other side of it, for
ten miles to where it joins the Victory Highway. Sam has
a sign at the junction with the highway; so no one has
any reason for using this road unless he has business with
the Desert Moon Ranch.</p>

<p>We drove to the highway before we turned around.
We had come back about a mile, when the wind, that
always ushers in a storm in these parts, came howling up,
blowing the sand and dust in thick clouds, jerking and
snapping the sage and the greasewood, chasing and
bouncing the tumbleweed balls. The sky turned black.
The thunder growled, mean as a threat, in the distance.</p>

<p>John drove fast; but we barely made the ranch before
the storm broke. When we came out of the garage doors,
the first drops of rain, big as butter cookies, had begun
to fall; and, just as we reached the front porch, the rain
came pouring down as if all the sky were the nozzle of a
big faucet and someone had turned it on, full force.</p>

<p>“This will bring her in,” Sam said, as we ran up the
steps. “She’ll be there, high and dry, when we get in.”</p>

<p>She was not. Chad and Hubert Hand had come in, and
they acted as if, since we had set out to get news of Gaby,
it was a wonder we had not done it. Martha was awake,
and sobbing because she could not have the fireworks.
Mrs. Ricker was showing a little last minute sense by
hurrying around and getting the house closed against
the storm. She should have done it when the wind first
came up.</p>

<p>Sam went and touched a match to the fire, ready to be
started, in the fireplace. I ran upstairs and closed the
bedroom windows, and turned the fans off. I don’t care for
buzzing fans during one of our electrical storms. I had
come downstairs, ready to take my rest, when I
remembered the attic, with all its windows wide to the
drenching rain.</p>

<p>My corns had been hurting me all day; so, Chad being
handy, I asked him to go and close the attic. He went up
the stairs, and almost at once came back to the head of
them to call down that the attic door was locked.</p>

<p>One of my principles is, that if you ask a man to do
anything about the house for you, you do it twice yourself.
I thought, again, how true that was, as I went on my
aching feet up the stairs to prove to him that the door
was not locked, never had been locked, and, likely, never
would be.</p>

<p>It was locked. Chad stood by, pleased as Punch, when
it would not give to my shaking and pulling. He walked
off, saying that he would see whether someone downstairs
had locked it and had the key, or, if not, whether
he could find another key to fit it.</p>

<p>I stood there waiting. I put my hand in my pocket for
my handkerchief. There was a key. It fitted the lock. I
opened the door.</p>

<p>About half way up the steps, Gaby was lying in a huddle
of pink wrap. Her hat had fallen off. I thought that
she was asleep. I spoke to her. She did not answer. I ran
up the steps and put an arm around her, trying to lift
her. Her head rolled to one side. I saw her throat. It was
saffron color, with great blue black bruises at its base.
I touched her swollen face. It was cold.</p>

<p>For an instant, my only sensation was one of violent
nausea. I tried to scream. My throat had closed. I must
have shut my eyes, for I remember thinking that, if I
did not open them, the dizziness would sweep me off into
unconsciousness. I opened them. I saw, there on the red
carpet of the steps, something that shocked my reeling
senses into sanity. Dropped all over the bright beaded
bag, lying there, were the burned tobacco and the ashes
from Sam’s pipe.</p>

<p>All of my horror concentrated into a frantic desire to
get those ashes cleared away so that no one else could see
them. I shook them from the bag to the carpet. I brushed
them from the carpet into my handkerchief. Just as I got
to my feet from my knees, Chad came up.</p>

<p>“Call the others,” I said. “Gaby is here—murdered.”</p>

<p>I stuffed the handkerchief filled with ashes into my
pocket, and, for the first and last time in my life, I fainted
dead away.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch17">

<h2>CHAPTER XVII. <br> Suicide</h2>

<p>The next thing that I knew I was lying on my back
listening to someone screaming, above the voices
of Sam and Mrs. Ricker. I realized that those awful
sounds were coming from my own throat. I tried to stop
them; but I could not. I put my hands to my throat to
make it stop the noise. Sam’s voice came, clear and strong
then—real, like a light in the dark.</p>

<p>I sat straight up. The screams ceased. “What,” I
managed, “is the matter?”</p>

<p>“Everything on God’s earth, that could be,” Sam
answered. “But here, Mary. Drink this. Get some sleep.
Nothing to be done, now. We’ll need you, to-morrow.
Some water, Mrs. Ricker——”</p>

<p>He shook a powder into my mouth. Mrs. Ricker held
a glass of water to my lips.</p>

<p>When I opened my eyes again, it was gray dawn. I saw
that I was in Mrs. Ricker’s room. She was sitting by the
window tatting. Yes, tatting; darting the shuttle back
and forth, back and forth, with her long, white fingers.
I watched her for a full minute before memory seized
me, and I cried out with the pain of it.</p>

<p>“Sh‑h‑h,” she warned me, in a whisper. “You’ll wake
Martha. She is asleep here on the couch.”</p>

<p>I got out of bed, shook my skirts down and fastened
my corsets under my dress. I felt in my pocket. The ball
of handkerchief was still there. I went into the hall
bathroom, washed my face and hands, and drained the last
crumb of tobacco down with the water out of the
wash-bowl. I washed the handkerchief, scoured the bowl,
and went back to Mrs. Ricker’s room.</p>

<p>As I opened the door, she again warned me against
waking Martha.</p>

<p>“Was the shock too much for her?” I asked, going and
standing beside Mrs. Ricker so that we might talk in
whispers. She stopped to pick a knot out of her thread
before she answered me.</p>

<p>“I didn’t allow her to go upstairs. She followed Chad
out of the house and saw him shoot himself. He died
within ten minutes. It was terrible for Martha. I had to
hold her, while Sam gave her the narcotic——”</p>

<p>“No, no,” I protested. “What—what are you saying?
Not Chad? What was it you said about Chad——”</p>

<p>“He walked out and shot himself, through the head.”
She pulled the thread looser on her shuttle.</p>

<p>I rushed out of the room, away from her. I staggered
down the stairs into the kitchen.</p>

<p>Sam, Hubert Hand, and John all jumped up from their
chairs and started toward me. John reached me first, and
put an arm around me.</p>

<p>“Chad——” I began, but I couldn’t get any further.</p>

<p>“There, there, Mary. Pour her some coffee, dad.
Quick! Here, sit here. Turn on that fan, Hand. Get some
water——”</p>

<p>“No, no. Tell me. Mrs. Ricker said—— It isn’t
true. It—it can’t be true. Not our Chad——”</p>

<p>Sam answered, gruffly, to keep the choke out of his
voice. “It is a damn shame, Mary; but, it is true. The
boy shot himself, not fifteen minutes after we found her.
Wait,” he went on quickly, “before you think <em>anything</em>.
I want to tell you what I have told the others. It is
God’s truth. That poor boy is as innocent of any
connection with the murder as I am.”</p>

<p>“Sam!” I managed, and hid my ugly, twisted old face
down in my arms.</p>

<p>I will say that the men did pretty well, just sitting
quiet, and leaving me alone, and letting me have my
cry out. It seemed to me I never was going to be able
to stop; but they didn’t bother me with comforting, they
let me get clear through to the sniffling and swallowing
stage. I was the first one to speak.</p>

<p>“What,” I said, “are we going to <em>do</em>?”</p>

<p>“We are going to do a lot, Mary,” Sam said. “We are
going to keep Chad’s name clean. Sure,” in answer to my
protest, “we all know. But, just the same, I’m mighty
thankful that I have his alibis for him, myself. A suicide
looks bad, you know. That is, it would until we find
Canneziano. This is his work——”</p>

<p>“But, Sam,” I said, “if he wasn’t let out of San Quentin
until yesterday morning, he couldn’t possibly have
got ’way up here that same evening.”</p>

<p>“We’ve told Sam that, a thousand times,” Hubert
Hand said.</p>

<p>“All right, all right,” Sam said. “But if I ever get that
long distance call through, you’ll find that Canneziano
was released a day or two early. She met him
yesterday——”</p>

<p>“How’d he get up here, Sam?” I questioned. “You
remember there were no tracks on the road except the
sedan tracks——”</p>

<p>Hubert Hand snapped me short. “Did you have a
passenger up from Rattail, yesterday, John?”</p>

<p>Sam spoke, before John could answer. “Son,” he said,
“did you, by any chance, as a favor to one of the girls,
bring that skunk here yesterday?”</p>

<p>“I did not, dad.”</p>

<p>“He got here, then, as I’ve said all along. Horseback,
across the deserts. And he murdered the girl. By God,
he’ll hang for it, if it takes my last dollar. He killed Chad,
too, as much as if he’d shot him down. We aren’t
overlooking a couple of murders, not here on the Desert
Moon. Not right yet. She went out to meet him yesterday,
I tell you. She brought him into the house, for
some purpose; through the back way and up into the
attic.”</p>

<p>“Without anybody seeing or hearing them?” Hubert
Hand questioned.</p>

<p>“Nobody was looking nor listening, as I remember.
You know damn well that, with the doors shut, nothing
can be heard from room to room in this house—let alone
upstairs to downstairs. I tell you, he killed her there on
the stairs, and he made his get-away——”</p>

<p>“If you think that,” I said. “Why aren’t you out
hunting him?”</p>

<p>“Hell!” Sam exploded. “Why ain’t I out hunting last
night’s lightning? The girl had been dead anyway two
or three hours—more likely longer, when we found her.
He had that head start on us. And he could ride. God,
how that skunk could ride; no mercy for a horse! He’s
gone. He went straight across the deserts, hell bent for
Sunday. He’ll need food. He’ll need water, worse. I’ve
telegraphed to every town within two hundred miles of
here. They are watching. I’ve ’phoned every ranch. I’ve
kept that ’phone hot for six solid hours. I’ve got posses at
every water-hole——”</p>

<p>“Listen, Sam,” I said. “You shouldn’t have doped
me up with that sleeping powder. Because, unless after
he murdered her, he walked downstairs, with none of us
seeing or hearing him, and into the living-room or the
kitchen, and put the key in my pocket, Canneziano is
not the guilty man.”</p>

<p>Sam’s pipe fell out of his mouth. I shivered. During all
of his talk, I had clear forgotten about those pipe ashes,
dropped all over the beaded bag.</p>

<p>It was Hubert Hand who put the question to me about
the key. He made me feel guilty. My explanation to them
that the key had been in the pocket of my dress, the dress
I had been wearing since morning, yesterday, had the
feeling of a confession.</p>

<p>“Still,” Hubert Hand said, when I had finished, “that
does not, necessarily, disprove Sam’s theory. If Canneziano
was let out of prison in time to get here yesterday,
he could have murdered her, as Sam insists, and he could
have given the key to some one of us to put in your
pocket. Chad, for instance, or——”</p>

<p>“No!” Sam thundered. “That boy, I tell you, is as
innocent as I am.”</p>

<p>The telephone bell rang.</p>

<p>Hubert Hand and John followed Sam into the living-room.
I stayed where I was. I had to have a minute to
think. The ashes on the bag? The key in my pocket?
Sam?</p>

<p>“Mary Magin,” I told myself, “for twenty-five years,
ever since Sam Stanley took you, a snivelling,
pride-broken, deserted bride, into his house, and gave you a
chance to make a life for yourself, you have never seen
him do a mean trick to man, woman, child, or beast.
You never even heard of a questionable nor an unkind
action of his. And you never will, for the simple reason
that the ingredients for anything but honor and decency
aren’t in him. If they were, he would not be Sam Stanley,
any more than bean soup would be bean soup if it was
made out of gooseberries and ginger. That being the one
certainty you have, at this minute, you had better hang
on to it tight; stop thinking and guessing; keep your
mouth shut; and you won’t go far wrong. Good
resolutions are easy to make. So is lemon meringue. Both
are almost impossible to keep.”</p>

<p>I went right on thinking. If Sam, I thought, had found
it necessary to murder Gabrielle Canneziano, he had
probably done it to keep something worse from happening.
Sickened at myself, for that thought, I found another
way of thinking, not much better.</p>

<p>It did seem to me, remembering the pipe ashes on top
of the bag, that Sam must have been there on the stairs
at some time after she had been murdered and before I
had found her. He must, then, be keeping some secret
concerning the murder. It did look as if, considering his
talk, he must be shielding the murderer, with every
ounce of his horse-sense and ingenuity, both of which he
had in plenty. But who would he shield to that extent?
Chad, alive or dead? No. Martha? Yes. But Martha
could not have done it. John? Not unless there was
something to it than one of us dreamed of. Hubert Hand, or
Mrs. Ricker? No. Danny? I thought not. Myself? I
couldn’t be sure.</p>

<p>The men came back into the kitchen. Sam looked ten
years older than he had looked ten minutes before.</p>

<p>“It was San Quentin,” he said to me. “Canneziano
was positively not released from there until nine o’clock
yesterday morning.”</p>

<p>“That,” I said, “lets him out.”</p>

<p>“And,” Hubert Hand said, “lets every man-jack of us
here on the place, in.”</p>

<p>Habit was too strong for Sam. “ ‘Well in,’ ” he quoted,
with a groan.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII. <br> Clarence Pette</h2>

<p>The sheriff, the coroner, the undertaker, a newspaper
reporter, and another man that the coroner had
brought along for a juryman, drove up to the ranch at
five o’clock that morning. It had been past midnight
before Sam had been able to get hold of one of them at
Telko, on account of them all being out taking in the
celebration there.</p>

<p>Sam and the sheriff had been friends for thirty years.
Sam’s money had paid for the coroner’s medical education.
They, and the others, were mighty sorry to have
to bother us at all, and their sole aim was to make as
little trouble as possible.</p>

<p>They interviewed each one of us, alone, but pleasantly
and informally, in the dining-room; each one,
that is, but Danny—the coroner, visiting her as a
doctor, said it would never do to pester her, in the state
she was in—and Martha, who was still asleep, and
whom they said it was no use to wake. They kept each of
us about ten minutes. They brought in the verdict of
died by his own hand, for Chad; and, murdered by person
or persons unknown for Gaby. They left, on tiptoe, holding
their hats in their hands clear to the end of the
driveway. The coroner and the sheriff both came, I think,
with the conviction that Chad was the guilty person; but
Sam was so right down violent about Chad’s innocence,
that they let that drop at once.</p>

<p>The sheriff left, I am all but certain, with the strong
conviction that I had committed the murder, and with
the resolution that he would not do Sam an ill turn by
depriving him of a good cook. The coroner, and the
others, except the reporter, were sure, I think, that one
of us was guilty; but were thankful to goodness that they
had not found out which one.</p>

<p>The undertaker did not leave with the others. He was
preparing the bodies to take them to Telko; there to await
the instructions that we could not give until after we had
gotten in touch, if possible, with Chad’s people, and had
come to a decision about Gaby’s burial place.</p>

<p>The reporter, whose name—not that it matters except
for its fitness—was Clarence Pette, waited to return to
town with the undertaker. While waiting, he went snooping
about the place, looking for footprints—there could
not have been any, after the deluge of rain the night
before—cocking his head to one side and the other,
writing in a notebook, making knowing, humming sounds
between his tightly closed lips. He had been bothering
me, like a fly on the ceiling, all morning. Finally, when
he came poking right into my kitchen, and opened the
door to the back stairway, I turned on him.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with you?” I asked. “If you have
any business, why don’t you go about it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” he said. “Precisely. Now, my good woman,
if you can spare me a few moments——”</p>

<p>Sam came ambling into the kitchen and threw himself
into a chair.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mr. Stanley,” Clarence said. “I was just telling
your cook here that, if she could spare me a few moments
of her time, I probably could be of much service here,
under these unfortunate circumstances. You see, we reporters
are, necessarily, detectives, in a smaller or greater
degree. Until I came to Nevada, I was on one of the large
San Francisco dailies. Not taking undo credit to myself,
I will say that, while serving there, I was instrumental in
getting to the bottom of numerous crimes. Have I your
attention, Mr. Stanley?”</p>

<p>Sam looked at him as he would look at some snapping
puppy that was pestering around his heels.</p>

<p>I don’t know what Clarence thought. What he said,
was, “Precisely. By mere observation. Trained observation,
that is, coupled with a naturally analytical and
deductive mind, <em>and</em> imagination. Observation, first. As
an example: since entering this kitchen, I have observed
that your cook——”</p>

<p>“If you mean Mrs. Magin,” Sam interrupted, “say
so.”</p>

<p>“Precisely. I have observed that Mrs. Magin has been
but recently divorced. She was married to a man of some
property. Of this she received a share, at the time of her
divorce, in lieu of further alimony. She has come here,
recently, from Chicago, where she lived in comfort, but
not in luxury. She did not keep a servant. Her daughters
were dutiful girls. All of her children, at the time of the
divorce, however, sided with their father.”</p>

<p>I glanced at Sam. He was resting his head in his hands,
elbows on the table. He had not, I could tell, heard one
word that Clarence had said. To my own discredit, at an
hour like that, I was curious to find out how a man could
make so many mistakes in so short a time. “But how——”
I began.</p>

<p>He was too eager to explain to allow me to finish the
question. “Very simple, for a trained observer. You no
longer wear a wedding ring; but the mark of one, worn
for years, shows plainly on your finger.” (My wedding
ring is set around with garnets; so I always take it off
when I cook, and hang it on a nail for that purpose, over
the sink. It was hanging there in plain sight, right then.)
“If you were a widow, you would continue to wear your
ring. Your clothes, your wrist watch, your silk stockings,
show that you have been accustomed to a comfortable
living. Since you came to Nevada, it was you who got the
divorce. Hence—alimony. Had you received a lump sum
of money, or monthly payments, you would not have
taken a position as a cook. You undoubtedly received
property, on which you can not at once realize. Your
kitchen apron, here on the hook, and like the one you are
wearing, has the label of a Chicago firm in its waistband,
and is of excellent material. Had you been poor, you could
not have afforded such an apron—more than likely you
would have made your own aprons. Had you been
wealthy, you would not have owned a kitchen apron.
It is easy to tell, from watching you, that you have been
accustomed to having help in your work—hence, your
daughters. If your children had been in sympathy with
you, at the time of the divorce, you undoubtedly would
have returned to make your home with one of them,
instead of remaining as a cook in Nevada——”</p>

<p>Sam, who had shifted his position, stretched, and
crossed one leg over the other, interrupted. “Oh, dry up,
young fellow,” he said, as if the sound of Clarence’s voice
had tuckered him clear out.</p>

<p>Clarence tittered; embarrassment, I think, made him
do it.</p>

<p>“And take yourself and your laughing out of here,”
Sam said. “If you need to be told that this isn’t a place
for laughing, this morning, I’m telling you, now.”</p>

<p>“But, Mr. Stanley, I assure you——”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Just get on out of here. That’s all.”</p>

<p>“As you say. I shall report to my paper, shall I, that
the millionaire owner of the Desert Moon Ranch is,
apparently, undesirous of having the murderer
discovered?”</p>

<p>“Report what you damn please to your paper,” Sam
answered. “But get out of here.”</p>

<p>That was all right for the Nevada papers, where Sam
was known; but, if the other papers copied the news, I
didn’t care to have that impression of Sam strewn all
over the country. It never did do any harm, I reckoned, to
have the press on your side.</p>

<p>So, with Sam glaring at me, I cozied Clarence up a bit.
Told him to sit down, and have some pie and coffee.
While he ate, I flattered his vanity by asking whether he
had formed any opinions concerning the murder.</p>

<p>“Opinions—no,” he said, pulling back his chin for
dignity. “Theories—yes. Theories, I may say, that I have
arrived at quite independently, since the testimony at the
inquest was without value. Observation, trained
observation, and a certain instinct that might almost be
described as clairvoyance.</p>

<p>“For instance: the contents of the bead bag, carried by
the victim. Apparently, rather damning evidence, there,
against Mr. Hand. Also, apparently, other valuable clues.
Pouff——” He made a gesture of blowing the beaded
bag and its contents off the palm of his white hands.
Since this was the first I had heard of the bag’s contents,
I was sorry to have them dismissed so airily. I let it pass,
not wishing to question him. “Even the coroner, and the
other members of the jury, untrained as they were, realized,
I am sure, that all that was too obvious. A murderer,
my good woman, leaves clues—but not obvious ones.
The contents of that bag were probably arranged by the
murderer, after the murder had been committed. By
someone, moreover, who had access to the victim’s
personal belongings.</p>

<p>“Regard this, please, as a suggestion, merely. Does it
occur to you that it is peculiar that a young woman who
was unable to meet the coroner’s jury, should, in the next
hour, be able to arise and assist the undertaker?”</p>

<p>“Is Danny up?” I questioned Sam.</p>

<p>“Teetering around like a sick little ghost. Mrs. Ricker
went to ask her about what dress to put on Gaby, and
nothing would do Danny but that she get right up and
help to lay Gaby out.”</p>

<p>“You see nothing extraordinary in that?” Clarence
persisted.</p>

<p>Sam made another profane request concerning
Clarence’s drying up.</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “she is her twin sister, you know. And
she is a loving-hearted, unselfish little thing. I reckon
she thought it would be the last service——”</p>

<p>“True. True. But! The victim was last seen at the side
of the house near the rabbit hutch. Suppose that, as
soon as she had gotten rid of the child by giving her the
bracelet, the victim had at once re-entered the house,
through the back way, and had gone, at once, up these
back stairs. Miss Danielle Canneziano was upstairs at
the time, was she not? Alone?”</p>

<p>I remembered Danny, coming downstairs, not more
than fifteen minutes after Gaby had gone through the
room. I remembered how fresh and sweet she had been,
and how untroubled, except for her headache. A dozen
defenses for Danny, who needed none, flashed through
my mind. I should not have deigned to use one of them, to
Clarence, but unthinkingly, I did.</p>

<p>“If you are hinting at Danny,” I said, “she had neither
the time nor the strength. If she’d had a year, she
wouldn’t have done it, and couldn’t have, with those
frail little hands of hers.”</p>

<p>“In my opinion,” Clarence returned, “that job took
science, rather than strength. It took fingers that knew
how to find the windpipe and the carotid artery at the
same instant. The Japs understand that grip, perfectly.
An Occidental might stumble onto it by accident. But,
granted your objection, that strength was required.
The young woman might have had an accomplice. One
who, filled with remorse, killed himself. Or one who,
in tense excitement, dropped the key into her own
pocket——”</p>

<p>I gasped. Sam rose. He took hold of Clarence at the
back of his collar, and at the back of his trousers, and
began pushing him toward the door.</p>

<p>Sam’s first remark won’t do to repeat. His second was,
“And now, you blithering fool, if you publish one of your
filthy, lying insinuations, against that little, grief stricken
sister, or against our dead boy, or against Mrs. Magin,
just one, in that rotten dirty sheet of yours, you won’t
be in Nevada long enough to get your divorce.” Sam
boosted him out through the doors.</p>

<p>All the Nevada newspaper accounts made much of the
fact that the fiend, who had committed the terrible
murder on the Desert Moon Ranch, had made a complete
escape, without leaving any clues of any sort.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch19">

<h2>CHAPTER XIX. <br> The Note</h2>

<p>No clues! Land’s alive! The place was positively
cluttered with clues; and most of them about as
useful, in the end, as clutter generally is. I am not saying
that none of them were of value. I am saying that a person,
out in a grove of aspen trees, all bending and bowing
to a high wind, would be sort of simple to go hunting a
straw to find which way the wind was blowing. That was
about how sensible I was, when I asked Sam, after he had
got shed of Clarence, about the contents of Gaby’s
beaded bag.</p>

<p>“It is all on the table in her room,” he said, “where I
put it for the coroner’s jury. You can go and see. But,
first, read this. It was tucked inside her dress. The
undertaker found it, and gave it to me. I dread giving it to
Danny.”</p>

<p>He handed me a folded sheet of paper. I opened it, and
read:</p>

<p>“Danny dear: If you ever read this, I shall be
dead—murdered. Don’t have me buried here in this God-forsaken
country. Take me to San Francisco and have my
body cremated. I love a flame. I hate the cold earth.</p>

<p>“You have had much trouble on my account, old dear.
Don’t blame me for having kept the fear and the dread
of this thing, which I felt certain was going to happen,
from you. You, nor no living person, but one, could have
saved me.</p>

<p>“Remember, Dan, that in spite of all the distress I
have caused you, and may still be causing you, I have
always, in my own way, loved you. Gaby.”</p>

<p>“Sam,” I said, “I knew she was afraid, yesterday.
Oh, why didn’t she tell us? Of course you men could have
saved her. Why did she go out alone to meet that fiend?”</p>

<p>Sam’s only answer was a slow shaking of his bowed
head, and a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“Mary,” he said, then, “will you give this note to
Danny, and explain to her how it is?”</p>

<p>“How what is?”</p>

<p>“I mean—— Well, she can’t leave the Desert Moon,
now, to take the body to ’Frisco. Until we find out who
murdered that girl, not a man-jack of us is going to leave
this place, for any reason.”</p>

<p>“Sam Stanley!” I gasped. “You can’t refuse. That’s
all. Own twin sisters! And Danny as innocent as a new
born babe——”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk like a book, Mary. Danny may be as innocent
as she seems to be, and—she may not. She, nor anyone
else, can leave this place until we have gotten to the
very bottom of this thing. That goes.”</p>

<p>“To think you paid attention to that fool reporter!”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool yourself,” Sam urged. “This note, in
Gaby’s handwriting, clears Danny of the crime, if all the
other evidence didn’t, which it does. We know that she
did not kill her sister. But, of all the people in this house,
she is in the best position to know who did do it. Of
course, if she is involved in this she is involved innocently.
If she put the key in your pocket, while we were out in
the car, she did it with no idea of what she was doing.
Just the same, I want her right here on the Desert Moon,
for a while. Mary, you take the note to her, and explain,
in your nice way——”</p>

<p>“I’ll give her the note, Sam,” I said. “But you’ll have
to do the explaining yourself. I’ll tell you why. It isn’t
right for you to try to protect anyone, not even Martha,
to the extent of refusing to allow one sister to carry out
the dying request of another sister.”</p>

<p>Sam dropped his pipe. As I saw the tobacco and the
ashes scatter, I was more certain than ever that I was
acting as a decent women should.</p>

<p>The door opened, and Danny came in. She was so pale
that her cheeks had sort of a greenish tinge to them.
Great dark circles spread far down under her eyes that
were red and swollen from crying.</p>

<p>I hurried to her, and put my arms around her. She
clung to me, and hid her head on my shoulder, and said
my name over and over. Sam turned away, as if he could
not bear to look at us.</p>

<p>I took her into the living-room, and sat down in a big
chair and held her in my lap.</p>

<p>“If only,” she kept saying, “if only she could have
left us in her beauty. She was so beautiful, Mary. And
now——”</p>

<p>Remembering what I had seen the night before, I
knew that I must get her mind into other channels if her
reason was to be saved. I thanked my stars, when I
remembered the note.</p>

<p>After she had read it, she cried harder than ever; but
I knew that it was crying of a saner sort.</p>

<p>“Will you go with me, Mary?” she questioned, when
she had quieted some. “To San Francisco?”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to talk to Sam about that, dear,” I said.
It was the habit of helping him, not any kindly impulse,
that made me continue. “I am afraid that Sam wants us
all to stay here, for a while. There, there, dear. You see
how it is, don’t you? Sam thinks that the duty of each
one of us, right now, is to stay here and help try to find
the guilty person.”</p>

<p>“Does Uncle Sam think we will find him here?” she
questioned.</p>

<p>I tried to tell myself that I had been mistaken; that
she had not emphasized Sam’s name in a hard, pointed
way, as she had seemed to do.</p>

<p>“There isn’t anywhere else to try to find him,” I said.
“Did you know about the key in my pocket?”</p>

<p>She nodded. “I knew about that,” she said.</p>

<p>“What else did you know about?” I asked, a mite
sharply, for there was no mistaking her emphasis this
time.</p>

<p>“Nothing,” she said, hurriedly. “Nothing. But, Mary,
doesn’t it seem possible to you that someone, clear from
the outside, did it? And gave the key to Chad, and asked
him to put it in your pocket? And that, for some reason
we probably never shall discover, Chad could not, dared
not, tell on the person who gave it to him? And that that
is why he shot himself?”</p>

<p>“And we hadn’t thought of that!” I gasped. “I do
believe it. It is as clear as day.”</p>

<p>Her sudden, definite silence talked as plainly as any
words she could have spoken.</p>

<p>“Danny,” I questioned, “you thought of that, but in
your heart you don’t believe it. Do you?”</p>

<p>“I—I want to believe it,” she evaded.</p>

<p>“But you don’t?” I persisted.</p>

<p>She was silent.</p>

<p>“Danny,” I pleaded, “tell me about it. Just tell me,
dear. I’ll never breathe it to a soul, if you say for me not
to. What is it that you know, or think that you know?”</p>

<p>She waited so long before answering me that I thought
surely she was finding the words with which to take me
into her confidence. I was so disappointed I could have
cried with her, when she hid her face on my shoulder,
again, and moaned, “Mary—I can’t. I dare not tell. I
tell you—I dare not.”</p>

<p>She jumped up out of my lap, and ran upstairs as if
wicked, dangerous things were running after her.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX. <br> A Confession</h2>

<p>John came into the room. “The outfit is back, or
most of it,” he said. “Darn their souls! Curiosity,
nothing else. But for this, they wouldn’t have shown up
for two days yet. I think the women went into the kitchen
just now, Mary.”</p>

<p>There they were, Belle, Sadie and Goldie, all huddled up
together like a bunch of something, near the back door.
As I came into the room, they jumped and screeched.
The only thing that makes me madder than being scared
myself is to scare somebody else. I spoke to them right
sharply.</p>

<p>I told them that I expected them to go about their
work, and to act like sensible girls while so doing. I told
them that we had enough to put up with, just now,
without adding a parcel of jumping, squealing girls to our
load.</p>

<p>Sadie, the sauciest of the lot, on account of imagining
that being married made her more independent than the
other girls, spoke up.</p>

<p>“We haven’t decided yet that we want’a go workin’
in a house where a murderer, and maybe moren’ one, is
livin’.”</p>

<p>“If that’s the way you feel about it,” I said, “the
sooner you leave the better. It is an honor to work in
the Desert Moon ranch-house, and you know it.”</p>

<p>“Maybe ’tis. Maybe ’tain’t.” Sadie sauced back.
“You’ll not get girls as easy to-day as you would of
yesterday. Murders and suicides—if it was a suicide—don’t
do much in makin’ a ranch pop’lar for help.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” I said. “If you are going, go now. If not,
put on your aprons and get to work.”</p>

<p>I could scarcely believe my eyes. The three of them
skedaddled out through the door. I felt sort of sick,
watching them go. Not because I’d have to teach new
girls the work and my ways, but because their leaving
gave me my first realization that the Desert Moon Ranch
was darkened by the shadow of sin, that the eclipse I
had feared was upon us.</p>

<p>When I telephoned to Sam, down in his office in the
outfit’s quarters, I tried to keep the truth from him;
saying, only that the girls and I had had a spat, and
asking him to find some new girls for me.</p>

<p>He came up, in about half an hour, with an Indian girl,
not more than fifteen years old, trailing along behind him.
Answering his nod, I went with him into the living-room.</p>

<p>“She is the only one I could get,” he said. “We’ll have
to send to Reno or Salt Lake. None of the outfit want
their women folks working here. I don’t blame them.
The Desert Moon Ranch is disgraced——” He stopped
short.</p>

<p>I thought that it was because he could not bear to go
on with what he had begun to say; until, following his
eyes, I saw that he was looking at a piece of paper on the
writing desk just in front of him. It had been propped
up against a vase; but it had slithered down into a curve.
He reached for it; read it, and handed it to me.</p>

<p>“I killed her. Chadwick Caufield. P. S. Sorry to put
you to the trouble of disposing of me. Make it cheap and
snappy. I haven’t a relative in the world. P. G.”</p>

<p>“A lie,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“I think so.”</p>

<p>“I know damn well it is. I tell you, she had been dead
two or three hours, anyway—probably longer—when we
found her. Listen, Mary. Between four and five o’clock—we
all saw her alive at four—Chad sat right there at that
piano, and he never left it once. Did he?”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t. I kept thinking he would, to join Gaby.
But he didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Between five and six o’clock,” Sam went on, “he was
with me, every minute of the time, down in the barn, and
coming up to the house. Never out of my sight. Between
six and seven he was with us all at supper. If he’d been
gone all afternoon, I’d know that note was a lie; know it
just as well as I know it now——”</p>

<p>“But, why did he shoot himself, then, Sam?”</p>

<p>“God knows. He thought he loved her.”</p>

<p>“But this note! A confession! Why would he die in
disgrace, when we know he was innocent?”</p>

<p>“God knows. To shield someone else, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Who?”</p>

<p>Sam dropped his pipe.</p>

<p>I heard him stamping the sparks out. I did not look
down. I did not want to look down.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch21">

<h2>CHAPTER XXI. <br> A Summons</h2>

<p>“It might be,” Sam said, as he refilled his pipe, “that
Chad did not write this. I’ll send it, with some of his
other writing, to one of these handwriting experts I’ve
read about.”</p>

<p>“He wrote it,” I said. “The writing is his. So is the
wording. You know it.”</p>

<p>I looked at him, straight. I felt something tighten
around my heart as if it had been roped by a professional.
I guess I was too sentimental. But I couldn’t bear to see
Sam’s good old face all aching with worry.</p>

<p>“Sam,” I wheedled, “have sense. We’ve a confession
here that will satisfy the world. He killed her; and, when
the body was found, he shot himself. Nothing could be
more reasonable. No one would doubt it. We can send
this to the papers—he has no relatives to be disgraced,
or to sorrow over it—and the Desert Moon will be
cleared of crime. One of your favorite sayings, Sam, is to
let well enough alone.”</p>

<p>Sam drew himself up to the top of his six feet and five
inches and looked down, from there, at me; away down—as
far, say as if I had suddenly dropped into a dirty old
cistern. “There is no question of well enough,” he
shouted, so that I could hear him in my depths, “until
the Desert Moon is cleaned, clean, Mary Magin. Cleaned
and fumigated, or destroyed. It is not going to be
whitewashed. There is someone on this ranch who is as guilty
as hell; who knows who committed the murder; who
aided and abetted it. We are going to find that person.
Then we will find the murderer. They’ll be hung together.
After that, we can leave well enough alone.”</p>

<p>“Suppose,” I suggested, “that Chad was the
accomplice.”</p>

<p>“I reckon,” he said, growing suddenly kind, “that
you’ve been through too much, Mary. That’s it. You
aren’t quite responsible to-day. I don’t wonder. But
reason with me, Mary.</p>

<p>“Somebody suggested, already to-day, that it was
Chad who put the key in your pocket. When did he get
the key to put it there? Well, say that he got it between
seven and eight o’clock, when he was out scouting by
himself. Did he meet some entire stranger, then, who
asked him to dispose of the key? Did he agree to do it,
as a favor to said stranger? Did he, later, shoot himself
and leave a lying confession to shield the stranger? The
stranger, that is, who had killed the girl Chad loved?
Chad did carry some secret to the grave with him, Mary.
I am sure of that. But not a secret that we can’t discover.
We are going to discover it.”</p>

<p>To doubt Sam, standing there before me talking so
earnestly to me, to doubt his honesty of purpose and his
goodness, was more than a question of doubting my eyes,
my ears, my senses, for the moment. It would have been
to doubt the things that had made up my life for the
past twenty-five years; it would have swept away all of
my accumulated certainties, all of my conclusions, all
of my standards, as a wind sweeps trash from the desert.
It would have uprooted me, and it would have left me as
aimless and as wind-tossed as tumbleweeds.</p>

<p>“Sam,” I began, resolved to tell him, then and there,
about those pipe ashes of his on the beaded bag. I had
waited too long. Mrs. Ricker was coming down the stairs.</p>

<p>“I think,” she said, “that Martha should not sleep so
late. I fear that she is sleeping too heavily.”</p>

<p>“It is a blessing that she can sleep,” Sam said. “She is
all right. Those sleeping powders are as powerful as all
get-out. I got them from a doctor in ’Frisco, when I was
down there last year, and they made me sleep when I had
neuralgia. I’m going up, though, I’ll have a look at her.</p>

<p>“By the way,” he added, from the stairway, “I want
you two ladies to be here in this room, at promptly three
o’clock this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Upon my soul!” I said, when Sam was out of sight.
“What do you suppose that means?”</p>

<p>I might have spared my breath. She did not answer.
But she did something downright unusual for Mrs.
Ricker. She looked at me; and, as I met her look, it
seemed to me that there was a pleading expression in her
face, as if, were she able to talk, she’d like to ask me to
do something for her. I have seen dogs look like that, at
times.</p>

<p>“What is it, Mrs. Ricker?” I questioned.</p>

<p>She shook her head, and walked to the windows and
turned her back on me.</p>

<p>I looked at the straight, gaunt back, and at her long
arms hanging at her sides. She seemed frail. And yet,
she could hold Martha still, when Martha was in one of
her tantrums, and that was more than I, a much stouter
woman, could do. She, with no one but Martha who did
not count, had been alone in the house for an hour the
evening before, while the others of us had been out
hunting for Gaby.</p>

<p>Sam insisted that Gaby had been dead two or three
hours when we found her. But was he certain of that?
How did he know? Might he be mistaken? Mrs. Ricker
had hated Gaby, as only a jealous woman can hate.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII. <br> The Pact</h2>

<p>All the while I was getting a make-shift dinner ready,
that last thought of mine kept bothering me like
the smell of something burning. So, as soon as dinner was
over (I need not have bothered with it; everyone straggled
in and straggled out again, without doing any justice
to good food. Mrs. Ricker and Martha did not even come
down.), I told the Indian girl, whose name was Zinnia, to
manage the dishes the best she could, and I went off up
to my room.</p>

<p>I took up some dinner on a tray with me, for Mrs.
Ricker and for Martha. When Mrs. Ricker opened her
door, I managed to get the information that Martha was
awake, at last, and that Mrs. Ricker had just been
helping her with her bath.</p>

<p>“Is she all right, now?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“I—suppose so.” She edged the door shut, in my
face.</p>

<p>I went into my room and combed my hair. I can always
think better when I am doing some absolutely unimportant
thing like that. But, to-day, it was as if someone
had put an egg-beater into my mind, and was beating
it to best time. My thoughts whirred, and tossed, and
foamed.</p>

<p>Sam’s pipe ashes. The key in my pocket. Chad’s suicide.
Chad’s note of confession. Gaby’s fear. Mrs. Ricker
alone in the house. What it was that Danny knew and
dared not tell? Not all plainly, and separately, as they
look in writing; but all jumbled, and each one seething
with its own details and complications.</p>

<p>Sam’s pipe ashes—— Lands alive! What had been the
matter with me? Sam was the only member of our household
who smoked a pipe, but he was not the only man in
creation who did; nor was his the only pipe, I supposed,
that had ever dropped and spilled its contents. A very
nice and comforting thought, if I could have fooled
myself into believing it.</p>

<p>Try as I might, I couldn’t keep from thinking that
part of Sam’s talk was bluff—that is, soon as I got away
from him I thought that. Did it mean that he was trying
to shield Chad? No. It could not mean that. Besides,
Chad himself had surely been trying to shield someone.
Sam? Gaby had feared someone, when she had left the
house. No woman had ever feared Sam.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker had hated Gaby. But, so had John hated
Gaby. Mrs. Ricker had said—— John had said——</p>

<p>I jumped to my feet, holding my head in my hands.
It seemed to me that the only decent thing I could do,
since it held my brainpan, was to wrench the disloyal
thing off and sling it away. How dared I think such
thoughts of people with whom I had spent the best part
of my life? They were the only friends I had in the world.
I had never seen one of them do an unkind thing. Never.
Mrs. Ricker was as queer as Dick’s hatband, but she
had always been gentle and patient. She had always been
the first to spread crumbs on the snow for the birds in
winter. Though, of course, she had said to Hubert
Hand—— I was off again.</p>

<p>I could not endure the thinking of such thoughts. I
must stop it. I must find work to do; someone to talk to.
I ran across my room and pulled open the door, just in
time to see Hubert Hand straighten from where he had
been stooping to my keyhole.</p>

<p>He brazened it out. “Sorry, Mary. But I guess it will
be dog kill dog around here, from now on.”</p>

<p>“Hubert Hand,” I said, “what I want to know is,
why are you listening at my keyhole?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t listening. I was looking, or trying to. This
keyhole peering is the bunk, Mary. You might as well cut
it out yourself.” With that he turned and walked on down
the hall.</p>

<p>I stood watching him, trying to account for an odd
sense of relief that had come to me. In a minute I
understood. Since he had been at my keyhole, he must have
had some suspicion of me, for something. Possibly he
had a good reason for that suspicion. As good a reason
as I had, for suspicioning Sam, and John, and Mrs.
Ricker. He was clear off the track with his suspicion.
Probably, I was just as far off with mine.</p>

<p>He turned, quickly, and came back to me. He looked
up and down the hall. He lowered his voice to just above
a whisper. “Mary,” he said, “I’ve gone at this all wrong.
I’m off my nut to-day—that’s all. I’ve discovered that
I—— Well, I guess I cared a lot more for the girl than I
thought I did. By God, I believe I loved her. It is
hell—having her clear gone. But my hanging for her murder
isn’t going to do her any good; not now.”</p>

<p>Horrified, I backed away from him. For one wild
moment I thought that the man was confessing to me.</p>

<p>“No!” he said. “Not that! I swear to God I’m innocent.
But they are going to try to pin it on me, and they
may not have much trouble doing it. I want to make a
bargain with you. You’ll get the best of it, for I know
damn well that I’m innocent, and I don’t think that you
are—entirely. It is this. If you’ll keep your mouth shut,
I’ll keep mine shut. Fifty-fifty. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>“Hubert Hand,” I said, “I don’t know one solitary
thing about you that would be of any importance if I
told it to the world. Anything that you think you know
about me, I’m glad and willing to have you broadcast, or
publish in the papers.”</p>

<p>“Sure of that? Sure you are willing to have me broadcast
that you found the body; that you didn’t scream;
that you stayed there, quiet and alone with it for ten
minutes, before you gave the alarm?”</p>

<p>Fool that I was, I said, “It wasn’t nearly ten minutes.
It wasn’t more than four or five.”</p>

<p>He smiled. I saw what I had done. “It took me that
long to discover the truth. I thought she was asleep. I
had to run up the steps——”</p>

<p>Double fool, to try to explain.</p>

<p>“Say it took you a minute to run up a few steps.
Another minute to discover that she was dead. Should it
take you three or four minutes to run down again, and
give the alarm?”</p>

<p>“I was sick, stunned, dizzy with horror.”</p>

<p>“Probably any jury would believe that, all right. Just
the same, I’ll bet it would save you a lot of trouble, now
and later, if no one knew anything about your lonesome
five minutes, or longer. I’ll tell you how I know. I came
out of my room at the minute you opened the attic door.
I saw you leave the hall to run up the steps. I went on
downstairs. Chad was kidding around down there,
collecting keys. I didn’t know what he wanted with them,
fortunately for you, or I’d have said you’d gotten the
door open——”</p>

<p>I interrupted with a new, and it seemed to me a clever
idea. “What you are forgetting,” I said, “is that I fainted
dead away.”</p>

<p>“Gosh, Mary, but you are a rotten liar. Don’t try it.
Sam and I both saw you totter and go down, just as we
got to the top of the stairs, after Chad had shrieked the
news down at us. That was close to fifteen minutes after
I’d seen you open the door.”</p>

<p>“And—and,” I couldn’t keep my teeth from
chattering, “you think I killed her, then?”</p>

<p>“Rot! She had been dead for hours. Rigor was complete.
No, all I think is that you were—trying to cover
someone, maybe. All that I know is, that you know more
than you are telling.”</p>

<p>“I did tell you. I was frozen, stiff, with horror.”</p>

<p>“All right. Tell the jury. Tell them, too, why you came
rushing out of your room, as you did just now, white
and trembling. Don’t like your thoughts, all by your
lonesome, do you? Come on, Mary. Be a sport. We are
both innocent. But—— Fifty-fifty? Shut mouth for shut
mouth?”</p>

<p>His talk about telling a jury scared me. I had heard of
third degrees. I knew that if I ever told anyone but Sam
himself, about those pipe ashes, the words would choke
the life out of me, as I would want them to do.</p>

<p>“Dog kill dog, then?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Hubert Hand, I’m going to be honest with you. I
don’t know what it is you want me to keep my mouth
shut about.”</p>

<p>“Don’t? Well, I want you to keep still about that
conversation you overheard between Ollie Ricker and me in
the cabin. She went back to get her parasol and saw you
coming out. We knew you had been hiding there in the
closet, listening.”</p>

<p>With the sense I had been showing, it is a wonder I
didn’t speak right up and tell him that I had not been in
the closet, but in the chest. I did not.</p>

<p>“Lands alive!” I said. “I’d had no idea of telling that,
anyway. It was none of my business.”</p>

<p>“Fine! I didn’t have any idea of telling anything,
either. It was none of my business. Shake on it.”</p>

<p>I let him take my hand. I said yes, when he made me
promise. I felt like I’d been associating with a
sidewinder.</p>

<p>I went on down the hall, wracking my brain to remember
exactly what I had heard in the cabin. Mrs. Ricker’s
threat. That would incriminate her, not him. And,
though the threat had proven, of itself, that she was in
love with him, I had certainly come away with no idea
that he was in love with her. His mention of a previous
attempt at murder, made by her. Again, that was nothing
against him. No; what he was afraid of having told, must
have been said in the room with the closet. I found
slight, but some comfort in realizing that, though I had
probably been a fool to make the promise to him, he had
probably been a worse fool when he made the one to me.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII. <br> An Omen</h2>

<p>As I was trying to hurry past Gaby’s door, Danny
opened it, and asked me if I would come in and
sit with her for a while.</p>

<p>I should have been there, long before. I went right in,
apologizing, and trying to explain. But, when I saw that
she meant for us to sit in Gaby’s room, I suggested that
we go somewhere else.</p>

<p>“No, please Mary,” she said. “I don’t want to be
alone; but I do want to sit here. I feel as if here, with
all her things around me, I might—get in touch—I
mean—something might come to me. They say, you know,
that people who have died—violent deaths, do not leave
the earth sphere at once. I don’t know whether I believe
that or not. But, it could be true. If she is still on earth,
she would come here. Wouldn’t she? And she would try,
I am sure, to give me a sign. Something to help me—to
help all of us. If it should come, I want to be here to
receive it.”</p>

<p>“It won’t come, Danny, dear,” I said.</p>

<p>“No. I suppose not.” She leaned back in her chair and
sighed, and her arms dropped straight down over the
chair’s arms—a position that showed how tuckered she
was. The engagement ring that John had given her
slipped from her finger and came rolling over toward me.
I scrambled to pick it up. When I rose from the floor she
had jumped to her feet. She was ashy, shaking and
trembling as if she had a chill.</p>

<p>“Mary! Promise me that you’ll never tell that, not to
anyone. It didn’t—— It couldn’t mean anything.”</p>

<p>“It means,” I said, handing her the ring, “that you are
wasting away. You’d better let me go down and bring
you up some good, hot soup; or an eggnog.”</p>

<p>She clung to me. “Don’t leave me, Mary. I am afraid.
I am dreadfully afraid. Promise that you won’t tell about
the ring. It—didn’t mean anything.”</p>

<p>I will admit that I did not like it any too well myself.
There, just as she was asking for a sign, the ring, which
had fitted snugly enough, I had thought, had dropped
off. But, of course I had to put up a brave front to her.</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” I said. “I won’t tell anybody, because it
is nothing to tell. All that it means is that the ring is too
large for you.”</p>

<p>“It is too large,” she agreed. “I’ve been losing weight,
lately. I have meant to ask John to send it to have it cut
down—but I hated to be without it. Still—just as I was
asking for a sign. Though it has dropped off several times
before this. I shouldn’t think it meant anything, this
particular time, should I?”</p>

<p>“Of course not, dear,” I said, relieved to hear that it
had dropped off before. “You had your hands hanging
straight down, that’s all. You are all overstrung, and no
wonder. Anyway, what could it have meant?”</p>

<p>How a person will babble along, seemingly for no
reason. I had paid no attention to what I was saying; but,
the minute I had said it, the question needed an answer.</p>

<p>It could have meant that Gaby did not want Danny to
marry John. Or, since nothing in the house could have
signified John’s name as plainly as that ring could, it
might have meant—— I refused to go on with it.</p>

<p>Danny must have been answering the question to
herself, as I had been doing. She sat down in a deep
chair, opposite me, her hands clasped on her knees, and
leaned forward, and looked into my eyes.</p>

<p>“Definite things, Mary,” she said, “are always so wise.
A definite answer to your definite question proves, as
nothing else might have, that this was a silly, futile little
accident. The ring has dropped off, I suppose, half a dozen
times this week. Gaby’s last note to me was all affection.
Living, if Gaby could have taken John away from me,
for herself, she would have done it. Dead—she wants us
to marry. I know that. As for any other implication——”
As I had done, and in spite of her talk about definite
things, she refused that. “If only Uncle Sam were not so
heartless,” she finished.</p>

<p>“Heartless!” I spoke sharply in spite of myself. “If the
Creator ever made a man with a bigger heart than Sam
Stanley’s, nobody ever saw him.”</p>

<p>“He has been good to you,” she said. “But you give
him his own way about everything.”</p>

<p>“Well, after all,” I said, “he does own the Desert
Moon.”</p>

<p>“And everyone on it, body and soul,” she said.
“Sometimes I think he owns everyone in this county.”</p>

<p>I did not want to know what she meant by that; so I
only reminded her that Sam was John’s father.</p>

<p>Her voice, when she spoke next, came muffled from
where she had hidden her face in her curved arm on the
back of the chair. “Uncle Sam is not John’s father,” she
said.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>“John is uncle’s adopted son. They are so different, so
utterly different, they could not be father and son.”</p>

<p>“Maybe not,” I said, trying to keep pleasant, for I did
not want to be snapping at the poor child on this day,
“but no real son ever loved his father better than John
loves Sam. He all but worships him, and he has ever
since he was a little fellow.”</p>

<p>“I know. I know. Sometimes I think John cares more
for uncle than he does for me. Mary, tell me, honestly.
Do you think John loves me as much as he loves Uncle
Sam?”</p>

<p>It is hard to explain; but, ever since we had begun to
speak of Sam, I had had a fighting feeling, as if I were
warding off danger; so I was right down relieved to have
the conversation take this silly turn.</p>

<p>“Love,” I told her, “though, mercy knows, I know
little enough about it, can’t be measured with a pint cup
like flour. But John is a good, normal boy. That means
that his sweetheart comes first with him; first and last.”</p>

<p>“I—don’t know,” she answered. “I should hate to
have John have to choose between uncle and me.”</p>

<p>“That is foolish talk. Why should John ever have to
choose between you and Sam?”</p>

<p>She sighed, and shook her head. A sudden certainty
came to me. Whatever it was that Danny had refused
that morning to tell me, whatever it was that she had
said that she dared not tell, had had something,
somehow, to do with Sam.</p>

<p>I did not urge her again to tell me what it was. I did
not wish to know. I sat there, dumb, trying to think of
some decent excuse that would take me away from her
and from that room, and from the need of fighting;
fighting, not in a fog, but the fog itself, trying to fell
nothingness with a blow, trying to catch smoke in a trap.
My dull wits worked too slowly. She began, again, to
speak.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch24">

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV. <br> Clues</h2>

<p>“What I can not understand,” she said, “is, that
Gaby knew that she might be killed. And yet, so
far as anyone knows, she did not do one thing to save
herself. If only, only she had confided in me! Surely I could
have found some way to help her—to save her.”</p>

<p>“You know, dear,” I said, “I think that Gaby was
not—well, at least not doing any clear thinking, those last
few days.”</p>

<p>“I know. I thought it was only her disappointment.
But now—— Who could be quite sane with such a fear
confronting her? Yet—she left all of her things in order;
as if, deliberately, she prepared for death. She burned
her papers and letters. See——” Danny pointed to the
fireplace.</p>

<p>I crossed the room and looked into it. Papers had recently
been burned there. I took the poker and stirred in
the fluttering, black bits; but nothing had escaped the
flames. I hung the poker back in the rack with shovel and
tongs and bellows. It did not catch on its hook. As I bent
to fix it, I saw a little white circle, down in the corner of
the stand. I stooped and picked it up. It was a tiny round
of celluloid, with the letter “Q” printed on it.</p>

<p>“It is one of the caps for her typewriter keys,” Danny
replied to my question. “She put them on over the keys;
softer for her finger tips, or saved her finger
nails—something of the sort.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why she burned them?” I said.</p>

<p>“Do you think that she did?”</p>

<p>“Well, this one being here on the hearth——”</p>

<p>“It probably rolled there, sometime, when she was
taking them off her machine.”</p>

<p>“Why did she take them off, if she always used
them?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know.”</p>

<p>“Shall we,” I suggested, “look and see whether the
others are where she kept them?”</p>

<p>Danny opened the desk drawer. “They aren’t here,
at any rate,” she said, and came back to me, and reached
out her hand for the little cap, and turned it over in her
fingers. “It could mean only,” she said, “what we knew
before. That she expected death. That she tried to leave
everything tidy and in order.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” I objected. “It seems more than
orderly, to have taken these off the machine and burned
them. It seems right down queer.”</p>

<p>She smiled a little pitying smile at me, and patted my
shoulder. “Poor Mary,” she said.</p>

<p>“Well,” I tried to defend myself, “in all the mystery
stories that I ever read it was always some stray,
meaningless little thing that solved the mystery in the end.
A criminal never was discovered without any clues, was
he?”</p>

<p>“I believe,” she said, “that you are the only one in
the house who hasn’t looked at what Gaby had in her
bag——”</p>

<p>She walked to the table by the window. I followed her.
I dreaded seeing that bag again; but I was curious about
its contents. It was lying limp on the table.</p>

<p>She picked it up, brushed it flickeringly with the tips
of her fingers, and blew on it, as if she were trying to blow
something off of it. “Everything,” she explained, “sticks
to the little pointed beads.”</p>

<p>I took it from her and looked at it closely; but I could
see no speck of ash, no minute particle of tobacco, nor of
dust on its pattern of parrots, tree branches, and flowers.</p>

<p>“It is a beautiful thing,” I said.</p>

<p>“Gaby got it in Vienna.”</p>

<p>“I’ve wondered,” I said, “why it was that Gaby had
all the beautiful, expensive things, such as this. Your
clothes are pretty and tasty, but they aren’t near the
quality of Gaby’s.”</p>

<p>She hesitated a moment before answering. “I have
been in England for the past eight years, while Gaby has
been on the continent, where beautiful things are more
plentiful, and cheaper.”</p>

<p>“Lands alive! I thought you girls had lived together,
all these years.”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, and picked up Gaby’s cigarette case,
and handed it to me.</p>

<p>It was made of a dull gold, with her monogram, “G.
C.” set in tiny black opals, with green and blue lights
flickering in them as if they were alive.</p>

<p>I opened the case. It was full of cigarettes, except for a
space at one side, where about two of the pesky little
things would have fitted in.</p>

<p>“And, see,” Danny said, opening the gold match-box
that was like the cigarette case, “it is quite empty. It
doesn’t seem reasonable that she would start out with
an empty match-box. I believe that she used the matches
to smoke the cigarettes.”</p>

<p>“She wouldn’t have used a box of matches to light two
cigarettes.”</p>

<p>“She may have shared her matches with another
person, who was smoking.”</p>

<p>“Likely she had only a few of these short matches,” I
said. (Sam would use about as many matches as that box
would hold to get rid of one pipeful of tobacco.)</p>

<p>I picked up another little gold box. It had powder,
rouge, lipstick, and a mirror in it. I had seen it often
enough before. I put it back on the table, and took up a
beaded coin purse that matched the large bag. It was
entirely empty.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it queer that that should be empty?” Danny
asked. “And her bill-fold is missing. She surely would
not start to go anywhere with not a cent of money.
Doesn’t it look as if she had been robbed?”</p>

<p>“Only,” I said, “if anyone had robbed her, why would
he have left the valuable gold cigarette case, and vanity
case, and match-box?”</p>

<p>“He might have thought they would be hard to
dispose of.”</p>

<p>I stood silent, thinking and shaking my head.</p>

<p>“Mary,” Danny’s voice, always low, grew lower still
with her intensity, “there is one thing that no one has
thought of. Daniel Canneziano could have reached here
from California in a few hours, by aeroplane.”</p>

<p>“I had thought of that. But, Danny, no aeroplane ever
came within twenty miles of the ranch without every
man-jack of us hearing it, and rushing out with our heads
tipped back to gape at it. Aeroplanes aren’t stealthy
things, you know, that people can slip up in, and slip off
again.”</p>

<p>“But, on the third of July, two aeroplanes passed over,
going to the Telko celebration.”</p>

<p>“On the third,” I reminded her, “as advertised. And
you know how much noise they made. And how we all
went out and watched them, from tiny specks in the south
until they were tiny specks and lost in the north again.”</p>

<p>She shook her head, and drooped her shoulders with a
sigh.</p>

<p>I picked up a little red handkerchief. It was crumpled
in a ball; if ever I saw a handkerchief that had been cried
into, and turned to a dry spot, and squeezed, and cried
into again, it was that little red wad. It was dry now, of
course; exposed to the air in this altitude. I wondered
whether it had been dry when it had come out of the bag.
It was a question not to be asked; so I dropped the
handkerchief on the table, certain, only, that the fastidious
Gabrielle had never started out with a handkerchief in
that condition in her Vienna bag, and picked up the
carved ivory cigarette holder. It fell to pieces in my
fingers.</p>

<p>“Was this broken in her bag?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes. Snapped in two. And she loved it.”</p>

<p>I fitted the pieces together again, on the table, and
took up a folded sheet of paper, and opened it, and read:</p>

<p>“Glorious Gaby: Be a good sport. Be a darling. Be
game—that is, be Gaby, and meet me this afternoon,
around four thirty, in the cabin. H. H.”</p>

<p>“Well!” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Danny answered, “but Hubert Hand
swears that he wrote that note several weeks ago. Too,
we know that he was playing chess with Uncle Sam at
half-past four.”</p>

<p>“He could have gone to the cabin later, when the men
went to do the chores. Or was he right with Sam and Chad
all the time?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so. He must have satisfied the coroner’s
jury, at the inquest, of his innocence. Mary,” her voice
went all tense again, “does it seem to you that the jury
was very readily satisfied?”</p>

<p>Perhaps this would be as good a place as any to explain
that this tale is not being written to prove that Mary
Magin was, or is, a wise, clever, or smart woman. As I
have said before, and will say again, from the beginning
to the very end I was a fool. I made mistakes, over and
over; and, as will be told, I made a disastrous mistake in
the end. If I had been blind, deaf and dumb, I could not
have been as big a fool; for then, all the time, I should
not have been imagining that I saw things, which I did
not see; heard things, which I did not hear; and I should
have been obliged to keep my clattery old tongue quiet.
The only virtue I can claim, concerning this story, is that
if I were a vain or a conceited person, I should never have
written it.</p>

<p>I spoke sharply, too sharply to her in answer to what
I had imagined I had seen in her attitude. “Never mind
about the jury being easily satisfied. Sam is not going to
be. He told me this morning that he would find the murderer
if it took every dollar he had in the world to do it.
Sam is going to get to the bottom of this. Be sure of that.”</p>

<p>“I—wonder,” she said.</p>

<p>“What do you wonder?”</p>

<p>“Mary!” she exclaimed, close to a reproach, “I merely
wonder whether or not Uncle Sam will succeed.”</p>

<p>I looked at her brown eyes, all red and swollen from
tears, and at the deep, dark circles under them, and I was
ashamed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV. <br> More Clues</h2>

<p>I put my arm around her shoulders and drew her close
to me. “Honey,” I said, “forgive your old Mary. We
are all overstrung, overwrought. I didn’t mean to speak
so sharply.”</p>

<p>“There is nothing to forgive, dear,” she said. “But—I
don’t understand. What did I say, or do, that made you
feel like being cross to me?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” I told her. “I’m all on edge—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I know. Were you looking for something else, on the
table? There was nothing else in her bag.”</p>

<p>“I was wondering,” I said, “about that foreign looking
letter she got on the second of July. Did she burn it, with
the other things?”</p>

<p>“Oddly, she didn’t. I found it in her desk; or, rather,
beneath her typewriter. Either she forgot about it; or
knew that none of us could read it.”</p>

<p>“It was written in a foreign language?”</p>

<p>“No. In code. Here it is.”</p>

<p>Code, indeed! When I took it from its envelope, this is
what met my eyes.</p>

<p>“Paexzazlytp! f-y nyx ogrgrsgo, rn fgao atf jan j-asn,
ahzgo zkg c-. ahhalo, vkgt nyx clplzgf rg lt zkg kypulzae,
zkaz nyx palf, vlzk nyxo lrlzazgf r-yta e-lpa prleg,
‘p-yoon, yef fgao, l- rafg——”</p>

<p>I have copied only the first lines on the first page.
There were four sleazy pages, all closely typewritten.
Not a scratch of handwriting on it. What I judged to be
the signature, was, “Slrsl.”</p>

<p>“Do you know who wrote this?” I asked.</p>

<p>“I am sure, if I dare be sure of anything, that it was
written by a man named Lewis Bauermont.”</p>

<p>I counted the letters of “Lewis” on my fingers. Five.
The number of letters in the signature, “Slrsl.”</p>

<p>“If he signed his name Lewis,” I said, “then ‘S’ would
be, ‘L,’ and ‘l’ would be ‘e’ and so on. Get a pencil, dear.
Let’s see if we can work it out.”</p>

<p>She came and looked over my shoulder at the
jumbled letters.</p>

<p>“No,” she said, “you see, the letter ‘s’ comes twice in
the last word, and there are no duplicate letters in Lewis.
I am sure it will be more difficult than any substitution
of letters. I don’t know anything about codes; but I
have a notion that the letters are mere symbols of
something else—numbers perhaps, that work out with a key
quotation.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have a try at my idea, anyway,” I
insisted.</p>

<p>I went and sat at the desk. She sat beside me, and
handed me a pencil.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” I suggested, “the man who wrote this,
signed some nickname. Did he have one?”</p>

<p>“Men called him ‘Mexico,’ and ‘Mexie.’ Gaby never
used either of those names for him.”</p>

<p>“What name did she use?” I insisted, though I felt
like a brute.</p>

<p>“None, except ‘Lewis,’ that I know of. She didn’t read
the signature, when she read the letter to me. At least I
don’t remember——”</p>

<p>“She read it to you!” I exclaimed.</p>

<p>“I thought that she did. Now—I don’t know. I can’t
be sure of anything. She read to me what she said was a
copy of the letter; that is, the worked out code. She
may have left out entire paragraphs. She may have
changed it, in any way, in order to keep her terrible secret
from me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but what did she tell you the letter contained?”</p>

<p>Danny looked at her wrist-watch. “It is too long even
to begin to tell, now. And—I don’t want to tell it
again; not to-day. I have told John all about it, you see.
Later, of course—— Or you may ask John to tell you.
It—it was an insult from beginning to end. An insult to
her. I can’t bear thinking of it, any more; not to-day.</p>

<p>“Mary,” her voice changed suddenly as did her
manner, “do you know why Uncle Sam asked me—almost
commanded me to be in the living-room at three o’clock
to-day?”</p>

<p>“No, Danny, I don’t. But he told Mrs. Ricker and me
to be there, too. I guess he just wants to talk to all of us,
together.”</p>

<p>“Oh—talk! What good is talk going to do? Talk, in a
place like this, now, where there is not one true, certain
thing to get hold of, anywhere; where not one of us can
believe in another——”</p>

<p>She put a quick hand to her lips; her eyes widened;
she turned, and hastily pushing aside the heavy curtain,
went through the clothes closet into her own room.</p>

<p>I sat still, at the desk. The paper before me, and the
sharp pencil in my hand, tempted me to make a list, as
they always do in books, of the clues, to date. I wrote:</p>

<p>“Locked door.</p>

<p>“Key in my pocket.</p>

<p>“T. A. (I put only the initials of tobacco ashes.)</p>

<p>“Chad’s suicide.</p>

<p>“Chad’s note. What person was he trying to shield?</p>

<p>“What did Hubert Hand think that I had overheard
in the cabin?</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ricker’s threat.</p>

<p>“ ‘Q’ cap for typewriter key.</p>

<p>“Contents of the beaded bag.</p>

<div class="subsect">

  <p>“1. Two cigs missing from full case.</p>

  <p>“2. Empty match-box.</p>

  <p>“3. Empty purse. Missing bill-fold. (Robbery?)</p>

  <p>“4. Crumpled handkerchief. (Tears? Pleading?)</p>

  <p>“5. Broken cig. holder.</p>

  <p>“6. Hubert Hand’s note.</p>

</div>

<p>“The code letter.</p>

<p>“Gabrielle’s note to Danny.”</p>

<p>This, I submit as the world’s worst list of clues. It is
the best example I have ever seen of the saying that a
person could not see the forest for the trees. The forest
was there, right enough. All I would have needed to do,
was to back off far enough away from the trees to look
at it.</p>

<p>My face burns, even yet, when I realize that, at half-past
two o’clock on the afternoon of the fifth of July, if
I had been possessed of just one lick of sense, I could,
instead of writing that list of clues, have written another
one; a list that, step by step, just as sure as straight
ahead, would have led to the guilty person.</p>

<p>Why did I not take into consideration the fact that, for
two months, the Canneziano girls had been searching for
something on the Desert Moon; something which I was
all but certain they had not found?</p>

<p>Why did I not give a thought to the fact that John,
after a secret conversation with Gaby—according to
Mrs. Ricker—had been clean and clear away off the
place since early afternoon until evening?</p>

<p>Why did I not include in my list the fact that Gaby
had given the gold monkey to Martha?</p>

<p>Why, instead of trying to puzzle out the code letter,
did I not read between the lines of Gabrielle’s last note
to Danny?</p>

<p>However, at the time, since it was of my own making,
I was quite well satisfied with my list. I took it to the
table to check over the items. Sam had put the key, with
which I had opened the attic door, alongside the other
things there.</p>

<p>I picked it up, now, and looked at it for the first time.
I had not looked at it, I had merely used it, the night
before. My heart jumped up in my throat. It was not the
key to the attic door. It was a rusty old pass key that had
hung on a nail in the broom closet, off the kitchen, for
more years than I could remember.</p>

<p>Whoever had put this key in my pocket, must have
been well acquainted with the Desert Moon kitchen, to
have found that old key, under the brooms, and mops,
and dust-rags, and chamois skins, and the rest, that hung
around it and over it in the broom-closet.</p>

<p>What had become of the key to the attic door?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI. <br> The Session</h2>

<p>When I went down to the living-room, at five
minutes before three, Danny, John, Mrs. Ricker and
Martha were all there. Danny and John were sitting at
the far end of the room. Mrs. Ricker was in a chair near
the window, tatting. Martha was on the biggest
davenport, playing with the monkey charm. I went and sat
beside her.</p>

<p>“I feel sleepy,” she answered my question. “But I am
happy, now. I am very happy.”</p>

<p>“That’s nice,” I told her. “But, if I were you, I
wouldn’t talk much about being happy; that is, not to-day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care. Gaby was hateful and mean, even if she
did give me the monkey. She was good, then; but she
wasn’t good long enough for me to like her. I’m sorry
because Chad died, though. I was awfully sorry, until I
happened to remember about heaven. He is happy there
now. When I die, I’ll go to heaven and be happy, too.
He’ll love me then, won’t he? I know he will.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Martha,” I said. “And he loved you here,
too.”</p>

<p>“Only like a little girl. I wanted him to love me like a
lady. He would have, I guess, if he hadn’t shot himself.
I am sorry he did that. But I’m happy, anyway, ’cause
we are going to have the fireworks to-night.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut,” I said. “We won’t be having any fireworks
to-night.”</p>

<p>Her lower lip curled out. “Daddy promised,” she
whimpered. “Yesterday, when it looked like rain, he said
never to mind, that we’d have them the very first night
it didn’t rain. To-night is the first night. Daddy
promised.”</p>

<p>To my shame, I never, in all the years, had gotten
used to Martha. She looked like a big, healthy, strapping
girl. And when, as now, I realized that a smart five-year-old
child would have had a better mind, it shocked me
all over.</p>

<p>Sam and Hubert Hand came into the room together.
Sam looked around, counting noses.</p>

<p>“All here,” he said, and locked the door he and
Hubert had come through, and dropped the key in his
pocket. He went all around the room, closing and locking
the doors and windows. He moved a chair to the foot
of the stairway, pulled a small table over beside it, took
his six-gun out of his back pocket, put it on the table,
and sat down in the chair.</p>

<p>No one had moved nor had said a word. I know that I
was frightened. I was not afraid of Sam, and I was not
afraid of that six-gun. It did not make me a mite more
uneasy than a bouquet of flowers would have; that is, if
Sam had carried the bouquet in and put it on the table
with the same manner with which he had carried and
placed the gun. Mostly, I guess, I was afraid of being
made afraid; partly, I was afraid of myself.</p>

<p>Hubert Hand spoke first. “Cannon, ugh?” he sneered.</p>

<p>“That’s all right, Hand,” Sam answered. “This is
here, mostly I think, for ornamental purposes.”</p>

<p>“Daddy,” Martha piped up, “aren’t we going to have
the fireworks to-night?”</p>

<p>Sam frowned at her. “Not to-night, daughter.”</p>

<p>She opened her mouth and began making those dreadful
noises she always made whenever she was crossed in
anything.</p>

<p>Sam rapped on the table, “Shut that up, here and
now,” he said. “Not another whimper out of you. Hear
me, Martha?”</p>

<p>She closed her mouth with a snap. I thought those
immense eyes of hers would pop out of her head. I am
sure that the others of us all felt the way she looked. In
all the years we had lived together on the Desert Moon,
it was the first time any one of us had ever heard Sam
speak impatiently to Martha. As for scolding her, being
stern with her, up to this minute it had never been in the
book.</p>

<p>“John,” Sam said, “you and Danny come out of that
corner, up here nearer the rest of us, and where it is
light.”</p>

<p>I tell you they came, straight, and sat on the small
davenport beside Hubert Hand.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” Sam began, “that all of you in here know
that anyone could walk up to any man or woman in here
and call him or her a murderer, and that not one of us
could give him the lie, right now.</p>

<p>“I reckon that you know, too, as everyone in the
country knows that, at this hour, the Desert Moon Ranch
is rotten with the muck of crime and suspicion. Maybe
you don’t know that it is not going to stay that way for
many more hours.</p>

<p>“We have called the law in, as was right and proper.
And the law has been real polite, and blinked its eyes, and
departed. ‘Folded its tents like the Arabs, and silently
stole away.’ Well, that’s all right. I didn’t much care
about having those fellows mix into my private business;
anyway, not until I had found out that I couldn’t attend
to it myself. I am not going to find that out. I can attend
to it. I am going to, right here and now. Later on, when
we need the law again, we’ll call on it. The innocent in
this room will have their names cleared. The Desert Moon
will be a fit place for a white man to live on.</p>

<p>“Now this gun here may look like I felt violent or
something. I don’t. And I’m not going to act violent.
This gun is here for just one purpose, and I’m dead certain
it won’t be used for that. A word to the wise, though.
No person, barring none and including the ladies, is to
leave this room until I give the word. No innocent person
in here will try to leave. Any guilty person in here—and,
before God, there is a guilty person here; guilty, at least,
of aiding and abetting—is going to have too much sense
to try to make a break. That is why I won’t need the gun.
Not, I mean, until we find the guilty person. When we
have found him, it may be of some use until the sheriff
can get here. That is all of that. Except that we are going
to stay here, one and all, right here in this room, until we
are ready to ’phone for the sheriff.</p>

<p>“If everyone does as I am going to tell them to do, we
should be through with this session by supper time. But,
if we don’t get through until midnight, or until next week,
we’ll stay here until we do. All I’m asking, of everybody
here, is that you all tell the truth. You’ll have to, sooner
or later. Better make it sooner.”</p>

<p>During this speech my dander had been rising. It had
got up pretty good and high by this time. “Sam Stanley,”
I spoke out, “you ought to know that you can’t force
truth out of anybody at the point of a gun, nor by keeping
them locked up. We’ll get hungry. We’ll get thirsty.
And when we do we’ll eat and drink and go about our
affairs. At least I will—unless you shoot me. I’m not fixed
to put up with this kind of foolishness.”</p>

<p>“Mary,” Sam roared at me. “That’s enough out of
you. You be quiet. You are going to do as you are told.
So are the others.”</p>

<p>Sam had never spoken like that to me before. It left
me limp as a drained jelly bag. Before I could get my
breath for an answer, Hubert Hand was talking.</p>

<p>“Changed your mind since morning, haven’t you, Sam?
You were dead sure this morning that no one on the place
had had anything to do with the murder; that Mary had
locked the attic door herself, earlier in the day, and,
absent-mindedly, dropped the key in her pocket.”</p>

<p>“Never mind about my morning’s opinions, Hand.
You are right. Dead right. I’ve changed my mind. Now,
since you are already going pretty good, I’ll begin with
you and work around the room, taking each one in turn.
I want you to tell everything you know, and everything
you suspect concerning the murder.”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” Hubert Hand said, “but I don’t know a damn
thing except that, apparently, she was strangled to death
sometime between four o’clock yesterday afternoon and
eight o’clock yesterday evening. We saw her alive at four.
We found her dead at eight. That’s the extent of my
knowledge.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now go ahead with what you suspect.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see,” Hubert Hand objected, “that suspicions
have any place here. Beyond stirring up a rumpus and
hard feelings, they wouldn’t get any of us any place.”</p>

<p>“That is for me to decide,” Sam said. “You were
mighty busy for a while this morning, throwing out hints
and slurs. If this session doesn’t do anything else, it can
anyway clear out all this whispering that is going around.
Just now, everybody here is busy suspecting everybody
else here. Suspicions usually have some reasoning behind
them. ‘Where there’s smoke there’s fire.’ It is only fair
to give everyone here a chance to examine everyone else’s
suspicions, and disprove them, if they can. If you think
that I did the killing, I want to know it. I want a chance
to prove you wrong. Come on now, Hand. Come clean.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I refuse?”</p>

<p>“That is up to you,” Sam drawled. “As the sheriffs
say, everything you say will be used against you. But, as
they don’t say, everything you don’t say will be used
against you, a sight harder. If I knew you had no
suspicions, I wouldn’t try to force you to invent some, just
to be sociable. But you were pretty free with your hints
this morning. All right. Talk.”</p>

<p>Hubert lowered his Roman nose and pulled at his moustache
for a minute. It was easy to see he was busy with a
decision of some sort. He settled back in his chair more
comfortably and, still pulling at his moustache, he began.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch27">

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII. <br> Hubert Hand Talks</h2>

<p>“Well,” he said, “I can talk all right. But I want
to start with this understanding. I don’t know any
facts that amount to a damn. You’re right that I have
suspicions. If you weren’t forcing them out of me, I’d
have sense enough to keep my mouth shut, from now on,
at least until airing them might do some good. But, since
you are determined to have them now, at the point of a
gun, I’ll say that I think John did it, and that somebody
else in the house is shielding him.”</p>

<p>Danny gave a thin, sick little shriek and threw her arm
around John in a protecting way. John straightened.
Under his tan I could see the color seeping out of his face.
Gently, he removed Danny’s arm.</p>

<p>Sam lowered his white eyebrows until his eyes looked
like two slits of blue light, glinting out from away behind
his face. When he spoke his voice was iron.</p>

<p>“Why do you think John killed her?”</p>

<p>“In the first place, John is the only one here who hasn’t
a water-tight alibi——”</p>

<p>“Not by a damn sight he isn’t,” Sam interrupted.
“But never mind. Go on.”</p>

<p>“At four o’clock Gaby came down through the room.
While she was still in sight, Danny called down, trying
to get her to come back. Now this is just another
suspicion, I don’t know whether anyone here will back me
up in it or not—probably not,”—he added the last in a
hateful, slurring way—“but I noticed that her voice
sounded strange, like she was excited, maybe, or else
afraid.”</p>

<p>Sam asked, “Did anyone else here notice anything of
that kind?”</p>

<p>I had decided, right at first, to keep my mouth shut
about everything; so I did.</p>

<p>“I thought not,” Hubert Hand said, as if he had known
from the start that he was the only honest one in the
crowd.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker spoke. “I noticed it,” she said.</p>

<p>Hubert bowed at her, in a sort of mocking way. Knowing
what I knew, I thought that her corroboration would
do Hubert Hand more harm than good. But, of course,
the others did not know what I knew. Nor were they
going to know it, since Hubert Hand was keeping his
part of our bargain. Right or wrong, I was thankful, just
then, that we had made that bargain.</p>

<p>“Let me see,” Hubert Hand continued, “where was I?
Gaby, after going through the room, stopped on the porch
for a minute to talk to Chad. He came into the house in
a fine humor. Gaby then went around the house to the
rabbit hutch, and for some reason, gave her bracelet to
Martha. When Martha’s turn comes, in this inquisition,
I suggest that she be questioned rather closely.”</p>

<p>Sam banged his fist on the table. “Never mind your
suggestions. You are accusing John now. Stick to that.”</p>

<p>“You bet,” Hubert Hand accepted, “especially since
Martha was in the house again within five or ten minutes,
with every last one of us. Danny had come down by that
time. From four to five, then, you and I were playing
chess. Chad was at the piano. Danny and Mary were
over there, talking together. Mrs. Ricker was tatting,
where she is now, by the window. Martha was bothering
us, part of the time, and part of the time she was just
fooling around the room. I’m pretty certain not one of
us left this room during that hour. You might check up
on that, Sam.”</p>

<p>Sam asked Mrs. Ricker, and Danny, and me, if we
remembered anyone’s leaving the room during that hour.
We all said we did not. Danny added that she might
not have noticed. I wished, seeing Hubert Hand smile,
she had let well enough alone and not bothered to add
that.</p>

<p>“At five,” Hubert Hand resumed, “we three men went
together to let the cows in and to milk. Mary, I believe,
was in the kitchen alone, getting supper, during that
time. Mrs. Ricker, Danny and Martha remained here in
the living-room. Is that right?”</p>

<p>“Maybe it is, and maybe it isn’t,” Sam said. “There
is the hour in there, before supper, that we’ll all have to
account for, right accurately, before any of us has that
water-tight alibi you were talking about, Hand. And,”
Sam added, with his own sort of emphasis, “we won’t
have it then.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Hubert Hand agreed. “You and Chad and
I went down to the barns together. We let the cows in.
We milked them. At least, you and I did. Chad stayed
with you and was kidding around down in your end of
the barn. I heard you laughing and talking down there,
together, the whole time. Is that right?”</p>

<p>“Practically,” Sam answered. “All but, I couldn’t
swear that you were in the barn during the entire time.”</p>

<p>“No? Well, I’ll admit that I hadn’t thought of that.
If I’d thought of it, I’d probably have known that you—how
is it?—couldn’t swear that I was in the barn during
the entire time.”</p>

<p>“Meaning?” Sam demanded.</p>

<p>“That if John is guilty, you’ll shield him with your
last lie.”</p>

<p>Sam’s fist knotted at his side. His voice was not iron,
now; it was tempered steel. “We’ll settle about my last
lie later, Hand.”</p>

<p>“You’re begging for this,” Hubert Hand reminded
him.</p>

<p>“Get on!”</p>

<p>“I milked four cows. Not very good, for the time—about
forty minutes; but as good work as you did. And
I will swear that you were in the barn the entire time.
Anyway, that is easy settled. Mary, did I, or did anyone
of the three of us, come through the kitchen and go
upstairs during that hour?”</p>

<p>“No,” I answered.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you,” Sam questioned, “going back and
forth between the kitchen and the dining-room?”</p>

<p>“No. Danny set the table for me. I didn’t step foot out
of the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ricker,” Hubert Hand questioned, “did any
one of us men come in, and go upstairs through the
living-room, during that hour?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ricker,” Sam asked, “were you right there,
alone, in the living-room during that entire hour?”</p>

<p>“I was not alone. Martha was with me. And, several
times during the hour, five or six times at least, Danny
came in from the dining-room to see whether she could
see John coming up the road.”</p>

<p>“Danny,” Sam spoke to her, “were Mrs. Ricker and
Martha in the living-room every time you went in there?”</p>

<p>“I—think so.”</p>

<p>“Only think so, eh?” Hubert Hand half sneered it.</p>

<p>“I mean,” Danny explained, “that I am sure Mrs.
Ricker was here. She was sitting right by the window.
I did not particularly notice Martha.”</p>

<p>“I can vouch for Martha,” Mrs. Ricker snapped.</p>

<p>“All right,” Hubert Hand went on, “so far, so good.
The ladies, I think, especially if you remember the glass
doors between the living-room and the dining-room, have
established alibis that would satisfy any jury.</p>

<p>“Now for you and Chad and me, again. We walked
together, carrying the milk, to the dairy. There we took
off the barn coveralls, and, at your suggestion, washed
up in the dairy kitchen to save time. We came back to
the house together. Mary said that supper was on the
table. We all sat down to the table together. All present,
you see, except John.</p>

<p>“Would it have been possible for you, or for me, or for
Chad, to have gone down to the barn (you and I each
milked four cows, remember), come back to the house
and through it, with not one of these ladies seeing us,
committed the murder, got back to the barn, and then to
the house again, all in an hour? I think, Sam, the wisest
thing you can do, is to grant us all our alibis for that
hour, anyway, and then work on from there, if you’re
bound to.”</p>

<p>I felt reasonably certain that, if Hubert Hand had gone
through the living-room, between five and six o’clock,
Mrs. Ricker would not tell of it. But I was more certain
that Danny, on the watch out for John, would have seen
anyone who had come in through the front door.</p>

<p>“The alibi hour sounds fine, Hand,” Sam said, “but
you are making a mistake. You are assuming that I think
that someone here committed the murder. I don’t think
that. I do think that someone in this room, right now,
knows who did it. Where any one of us was, or was not,
at the particular hour you’re making such a stew about,
probably doesn’t cut any ice.”</p>

<p>“I think it does. I began this, you know, by saying
that I thought John——”</p>

<p>“You said that once,” Sam interrupted. “Once is
plenty. Go ahead with it now, if you can. Give your
proofs.”</p>

<p>“There you go. I told you I didn’t have any proofs,
didn’t I, when you made me talk? But I have got some
pretty solid bases for my suspicions. John decided, all of
a sudden, to go to Rattail for the mail—or something.
The kidding he came in for, right then, shows whether
he usually went for the mail on a holiday afternoon. He
was gone four hours instead of the two—two and a half,
anyway—that he could have made it in. He had two bum
excuses. First, tire trouble. That would be a better excuse,
if the car wasn’t standing in the garage right now with the
same tires on it that he started out with.”</p>

<p>“I know you said you had no proof of anything,” Sam
broke in. “I reckon, of course, you can prove that,
though?”</p>

<p>John spoke. “I don’t think he could prove it, dad, since
the spare was a Truetread, same as the others. But he’s
right. I changed tires twice, that’s all. The spare was
rotten. When I had the second blow-out, I patched the
first tire and put it back on. The patch is there, to prove
that.”</p>

<p>“And the rotten spare?” Hubert Hand questioned.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t worth bothering to put on the rack. I rolled
it off across the desert.”</p>

<p>“My mistake,” Hubert Hand said. “Maybe. Two
hours is a long time to change tires, even twice. The
second excuse was, that he had met Leo Saule and had given
him a tow. Saule is a rotten little half-breed, who could
be bought for a half dollar. Also, he lives alone, away
off the main road——”</p>

<p>John jumped to his feet. “Get this, Hand——”</p>

<p>Sam had jumped too. He got to John and put his hands
on his shoulders. “Keep your shirt on, son. I am to blame
for this. Your turn is coming. Wait for it. Go on, Hand.”</p>

<p>John hesitated, and sat down again. Sam went back to
his chair by the table.</p>

<p>“Sorry,” Hubert Hand apologized, “I don’t like this a
damn bit better than John does; but it seems to be up to
me. Well, then, he came in two hours late. He came
through the kitchen; and, instead of leaving the car in
the garage, he left it in the back entrance. He went
straight upstairs. It took him half an hour, or more, to
get shaved and change his clothes. When he came down
he acted like a man in a daze. He couldn’t eat. He offered
being out in the sun as an excuse. He is out in the sun
every day.</p>

<p>“I think that he had met Gaby, as they had planned,
right after dinner when he started for Rattail. Maybe she
had promised him to leave the place. He was crazy to get
her off the ranch. I know that. He told me so, just the
other day—said she was making trouble here, and so on.
She may have had something on him, that she was
threatening to tell Danny, or Sam. I don’t know about that,
either. I don’t know a damn thing about whatever they
might have had between them. But I think that he killed
her, out on the desert some place.</p>

<p>“I don’t think that he had planned to do it. I think he
must have threatened her, off and on, though; her note
to Danny, and other things, show that she was afraid for
her life. All the same, I think he started it, yesterday, as
a bluff. But the desire was back of the bluff—that’s pretty
certain.</p>

<p>“I don’t know why he brought her body back and hid
it in the house. I don’t give him credit for figuring out
what a smart thing that was to do. He may have been
afraid of footprints in the road, or on the desert, if he
carried the body away and tried to hide it out there. He
didn’t know that the storm was coming, to cover up his
traces. I think, though, that it was pure funk that made
him come driving home with the body hidden in the
car—covered with the sacks of rock salt.</p>

<p>“I didn’t like to think that it was Danny who helped
him out, after that. It didn’t seem like her. I couldn’t
think of anyone else, though, who would help him. In
the last few minutes, I’ve managed to think of someone
else. It is a lucky thing for John. You are a damn sight
stronger ally, Sam, than Danny or any one else would
have been. For instance—this present magnificent bluff
of yours.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Sam said. “All through?”</p>

<p>“I’m satisfied, if you are,” Hubert Hand answered.</p>

<p>“I’m not,” Sam drawled. “Because, like the caterpillar
said, ‘It’s all wrong from beginning to end.’ It is a queer
thing, though, the way quotations always come to me.
Most of the time you were talking, Hand, I kept thinking
of this one: ‘Give a guilty man enough rope and he will
hang himself.’ ”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII. <br> John Talks</h2>

<p>“If you mean me, dad,” John spoke right up, and I’d
given a pretty penny to have had him say something
else, for, of course, Sam had not meant him, “I’m not
worried. They don’t hang innocent men in Nevada, no
matter how much rope their friends present them with.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact,” Hubert Hand said, “I guess they
don’t hang any men in Nevada, now, do they? Lethal
chamber, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Sam growled at him to shut up; and told John that it
was his turn to talk, and to go ahead and to try to talk
sense, if possible.</p>

<p>“I don’t know where to begin,” John said. “I’ve got
nothing to talk about.”</p>

<p>“Begin at the beginning. What did Gaby say to you,
after dinner, that made you decide, right off, to go to
Rattail?”</p>

<p>“I’ve told you that already. I’ve got no changes to
make in it. Gaby told me, after dinner, that Danny’s
headache was getting worse. She said that Danny had
sent to Salt Lake for a certain kind of headache medicine,
the only kind that ever did her any good. She said it
should have come in the morning’s mail. She said that
Danny would be peeved at her for telling me about it—asking
me to go, that is. So, if I didn’t want a fuss, and
wanted to be allowed to go, I’d better make a sneak of it,
with no explanations. I did. Here is something I haven’t
told, though, for Danny just told me, when we came in
here at three. She hadn’t sent for any headache medicine
to Salt Lake, nor anywhere. That certainly looks as if
Gaby wanted to get either me, or the sedan, off the job
and out of the way, yesterday afternoon. She must have
had some reason for sending me on a fool’s errand like
that.”</p>

<p>“Well, well, go on, son,” Sam said, after we had all
sat in dead silence for about a minute.</p>

<p>“Go on where?” John asked. “I’ve got nothing more
to say. Hand’s told the rest of it, hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Answer him, you fool,” Sam roared. “You’ve got
answers, haven’t you? Use ’em. Sitting there like a
dummy! Did anyone see you towing Saule to his place?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of. I towed him all right; but I can’t
prove it. Hand was right when he said he could be bought
for a half dollar. He might come cheaper. I’d try him
with a quarter, first, Hand.”</p>

<p>“Good God!” Sam shouted. “What are you trying to
do? Pry your way into the lethal chamber? Can you give
a reason for driving to the back door, instead of leaving
the car in the garage?”</p>

<p>“Only two hundred-pound sacks of rock salt. They’d
dumped them on the platform for us this morning from
Eighteen. I could give a reason for bringing them up,
instead of leaving them there until we went down with the
truck. Sure, I’m full of reasons. Got a good reason for
taking half an hour to bathe and dress. It would be hard
to find a guy with more reasons than I can produce for
everything—all, but murdering the twin sister of the girl
I love.”</p>

<p>“Son,” Sam said, “I don’t blame you a damn bit for
being sore clear to the bone. But, come to that, we haven’t
any right to blame Hand, here, either; not if he is honest
in his suspicions, and, maybe, he is. I forced them out of
him. Can’t you swallow your pride, for a while, and——”</p>

<p>“I’ve swallowed it already,” John said, “if that’s what
you want. Swallowed it till I’m choked with it.”</p>

<p>“I know, I know. But it is like this, John—and this
goes for all you folks, too—a person can’t get to the
bottom of anything without going down. In this case, it
looks like we were going to have to go pretty low down—a
trip to hell for most of us, I reckon. But it will be a
round trip. Most of us will come up clean, to a clean
Desert Moon. Can’t we go down, then, like a lot of
reasonable human beings, and not like a kennel of yapping
dogs?”</p>

<p>“It won’t hold, dad,” John answered. “Not this round
trip to hell stuff, as human beings. If I hadn’t stopped
being a human being; that is, a man, I wouldn’t have sat
still here and let Hand have his say out. And I wouldn’t
have done it, not to save my own neck. But I know how
you feel about the ranch. I’ve gone through with it for
that reason, and—for Danny, though I know that all of
this is a rotten mistake on your part. I know that; but it
is no use telling you, now that you’ve started. I’ll go on
with it, the best I can. I guess the others will, too. But
none of us will come up clean, as you say. Don’t look for
that—not after this muck. All right. Hop to it, dad.
What’s your next question?”</p>

<p>I was relieved when Sam asked, “Do you suspect,
with reason, anyone in this room?” I had thought, following
right along with Hubert Hand’s accusations, as Sam
had been doing, that his next question would be about
what was troubling and bothering John when he came in.
Why he had acted so queerly that he had had to explain
it by saying he was loco from the sun.</p>

<p>“I do not.” John answered Sam’s question, straight.
“But it seems darn queer to me the way everyone is
leaving Chad’s suicide out of this. Hold on, dad! I’m
not saying that I think Chad killed her. I know he didn’t.
But I know just as well that he didn’t walk out and
shoot himself simply because he had loved Gaby. Chad
was a queer bird, all right. I guess none of us understood
him very well. He was as emotional as the deuce,
too—I’ll grant that. But he was not, ever, a damn fool.”</p>

<p>“John!” Danny interrupted. “Do you think that a
man who kills himself, when he finds that the girl he loves
has been cruelly murdered, needs to be a fool?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” John answered. “A man might not care much
about living, after that, but if he killed himself he’d be a
fool. I mean—— It is like this. Regular fellows, and Chad
sure was one, don’t walk out and kill themselves, when
they find the girl they love is dead. It takes more than
death to make a real man kill himself. Sounds like a
book, I know; but, loss of honor is a reason, and
shame—maybe that’s the same thing—is another reason. Or, a
fellow might kill himself to save the honor of his girl—or
to save a friend’s life, if he owed the friend a lot——”</p>

<p>Danny interrupted again. “Absolute despair should be
a reason——”</p>

<p>“Sure, I know how you mean. But Chad had despaired
of Gaby’s love long ago. Dozens of times I’ve seen her
treat him so rottenly that, if he had been the suicidal
sort, he would have killed himself right then. No sir.
I tell you Chad did not shoot himself because Gaby was
dead. Sure, that was a part of it; but not the main part.</p>

<p>“Chad was a darn good guy. Good all the way through.
We all know that he didn’t kill her. We’d know it, if dad
didn’t have his alibis for him. But what I’m getting at is,
that, someway or other, and not meaning to at all, he
got himself mixed up in it. When he saw what had
happened, and realized that he had been involved——
There’s your reason, all right. I think that, if we can find
out why Chad shot himself, we’ll find out most of the
other things we want to know. I’m through, dad. I’ve said
all I’ve got to say, and more too.”</p>

<p>Sam hesitated a minute. I was relieved to see him take
Chad’s note out of his pocket. “Chad says that he killed
her,” he said, and read the note aloud. Everyone but me,
to whom it was no surprise, and Martha, who was almost
asleep again, squeaked, or gasped, or otherwise showed
their horrified astonishment.</p>

<p>John spoke first. “I’ll bet four dollars he never wrote
it.”</p>

<p>Sam passed the paper to him. “It looks like his writing.
It sounds like him too. Soon as I can get track of one of
these what-you-may-call-em’s, handwriting experts, I’m
going to send it to him. I reckon it will match up all right.
I wish there was an expert of some kind that we could
send it to, to find out why he wrote it.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Sam,” Danny said, and I could see that the
note had upset her pretty badly, “there is something
no one has thought of. We haven’t had time to think.
But, where was Chad during the hour we were hunting
for Gaby? You, and John, and Mary and I were in the
sedan. But where were the others, during that time;
between seven and eight o’clock, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I reckon,” Sam spoke real gently to her, “that we
have all had time to do some tall thinking about that
hour, little girl. But there couldn’t be any doubt that
Gaby had been dead a sight longer than an hour, when
we found her.”</p>

<p>“But can you know that, for a certainty?” Danny
insisted.</p>

<p>“Just as certain as I know that she was dead, Danny.
I—— Well, in the early days here—— Never mind that,
though. I’ve had experience with deaths, kind of on that
order. I know. The coroner and the sheriff knew. But, she
might have been brought into the house during that hour.
Hand let loose on his alibi business a little too early——”</p>

<p>“I’m no fool,” Hubert Hand interrupted. “You admit
that she could not have been murdered during the hour
between six and seven. Every one of us, except John, can
account for every minute of our time from four o’clock,
when we saw Gaby alive, up to seven.”</p>

<p>“All right. All right,” Sam said. “Have it your own
way. But you’ve had your say, and plenty of time to say
it in. You’ll maybe have another turn later. Now, keep
still. We are going to hear from the others.</p>

<p>“It is your turn next, Danny, I’m sorry. You understand,
we haven’t any time to lose. Take it easy, though.
Do you suspect, with reason, anyone in this room of
being connected with the murder?”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX. <br> Danny</h2>

<p>“I think,” Danny said, “that Chad did it.”</p>

<p>Sam lowered his brows, and turned those blue
searchlights of his on her. “That is a bad beginning, my
girl,” he said, kindly enough, though. “You don’t think
that. Not for a minute. Better start over again.”</p>

<p>“Uncle Sam,” she pleaded, “listen. You spoke about
clearing everyone’s name, and about the honor of the
Desert Moon. Chad’s confession does that—does all of it.
Why not let well enough alone?”</p>

<p>My own words; but I had not expected to hear them
from Danny. The only reason for them seemed to be that
Hubert Hand had frightened her with his case against
John. Was she the sort of girl who would keep on loving
John, and marry him, if she thought that he had killed
her sister? I did not believe it.</p>

<p>John said, “Danny!” And, knowing as little as I do
about being loved, I knew that I should hate to have my
sweetheart pronounce my name with a pinch of horror,
and a pinch of anger, and a big dash of bewilderment, as
John had pronounced hers.</p>

<p>Sam said, “Somebody else suggested that to-day,
Danny. I told them that there was no question of well
enough while the man who had murdered your sister was
going about alive, and while his helper was keeping his
secret on the Desert Moon.”</p>

<p>“You said that?” Danny questioned, and gave us all
another severe shock by accenting the pronoun.</p>

<p>“I said that, yes.” Sam showed signs of rising dander.
“And I thought that you, if anyone, more than anyone,
would agree with me.”</p>

<p>“Only,” she answered, “I should rather let a guilty
person go free, escape, than to persecute an innocent
person.”</p>

<p>“No innocent person is going to be persecuted on the
Desert Moon,” Sam said, “and no guilty one is going to
escape, either. You’re going to be a good, sensible girl,
too, and answer a few questions I want to ask you.</p>

<p>“First thing I want to know is, what was it that you
girls were hunting for, all the time, here on the ranch?”</p>

<p>“We had been told,” Danny answered, “that there was
a very large sum of money hidden here on this place.
We came to get it. That is—Gaby did. I mean—before
we left the continent I knew that I wanted to stay here,
for a long time. I cared much more about staying here,
and keeping Gaby here, than I cared about finding the
money. Really, I—I hoped not to find the money. The
people with whom I had been living in England had
broken up their home there. I had no home. That is how
I happened to be in Switzerland, with Gaby. I——”</p>

<p>She broke down, and hid her face in her hands. We all
sat, quietly, and waited.</p>

<p>With her face still covered she appealed to Sam. “Uncle,
I can’t tell all this, to-day, I can’t. I loved Gaby. I
did love her. If she were alive—— But she isn’t. Please,
please don’t force me to go on with this.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got me wrong, Danny,” Sam said, “I didn’t
expect you to tell about all of your past lives, and that.
But this stuff now about money hidden here. Could it
have any bearing on the murder?”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “I think not. Not possibly. There
was no money here, anyway, as it turned out. That is—if
Gaby told me the truth about anything. I thought that
she did. But now—she spoke of keeping fear and dread
from me, in her last note to me. I—— I can’t talk of this,
to-day, I tell you!”</p>

<p>“See here, dad,” John spoke up, “Danny isn’t fit to go
through with this to-day. I think she has told me everything
she has to tell. She told me most of it this morning.
I’ve got it straight. How about allowing me to go on
with it?”</p>

<p>“Do you think any of it might have a bearing on the
murder?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think it might.”</p>

<p>Sam banged on the table with his fist. “By God,” he
roared, “what kind of people have I got to deal with?
Not five minutes ago, you sat right there and swore that
you had told everything you know. Couldn’t even begin.
Couldn’t think of a thing to say. No suspicion. No hints
of any kind, except a slur at a dead boy. Now you come
out with this. By the Lord, Hand, you may be a better
man than I think you are——”</p>

<p>Danny’s voice cut in like scissors slithering through
taffeta silk. “Be careful, there,” she said. I remembered
the way she had brushed the beaded bag. Something cold
went trailing down my backbone. It was time, and past,
I thought, for me to take a hand.</p>

<p>“Sam,” I said, “what’s become of all your fine talk
about us not acting like yelping dogs, and swallowing our
pride, and helping out, and so on? I told you, when you
started this, that it was a fool piece of business. You,
nor nobody, can force truth out of folks. You’re kind of
back on your quotations, or you’d remember the one
about leading a horse to water. How do you think anyone
is ever going to get any place with you pounding and
shouting and blaspheming around all the while? If you
think the fact that John wouldn’t betray Danny’s
confidence to satisfy a crazy whim of yours makes him out a
murderer, you’ve got less sense at sixty-five than you
had when you were born. The best thing you can do, is
to follow your advice to me, and be quiet. John’s ready
to talk now, if you’ll keep still and give him half a
chance.”</p>

<p>I have never yet seen the man who wouldn’t quiet
down, mild as mush, when a sensible woman took it on
herself to give him a good scolding. The strongest man
will drop before a good, strong volley of woman’s words,
the same as he would before a shooting squad.</p>

<p>“Go on, John,” I said, seeing that Sam had dropped,
and wanting John to get a start before Sam had had time
to pick himself up, and dust off, and ask Danny what
she had meant by hissing at him to be careful.</p>

<p>“Shall I, Danny?” John asked. She nodded.</p>

<p>“It isn’t any too pleasant, even for me,” John began,
“but the straight of it is, that while Danny, for years,
was a companion to this lady in England, Gaby was
running around over Europe with a darned rotten lot of
associates. On the face of things, she was an actress;
leading lady with a company that traveled all over the
country—over several countries—giving plays. That
seemed to be mostly a blind, though, for her real occupation,
which was leading lady with a crew of blackmailers.
Danny doesn’t admit it, but I think there is no doubt but
that she had a lover named Lewis Bauermont—something
like that. He was leading man in the theatrical
company, manager of it, and also of the blackmailing
gang.</p>

<p>“About six months before Danny wrote here, the lady,
whom Danny had been serving as a companion, died. It
left Danny at loose ends. She had stayed there more for
love than for money. She had next to no money saved.
Gaby wrote that she could give her a small part in her
company. Danny joined her in France. She had been
there a couple of weeks, when the company went on the
rocks. Danny thought it was done purposely, since one of
their blackmail victims was making it too hot for them.</p>

<p>“Gabrielle and Danny went to Switzerland. This
Lewis what’s-his-name——”</p>

<p>“Bauermont.”</p>

<p>“Bauermont, showed up there in a few days and hung
around. He and Gaby got to quarreling all the time.
Gaby, who had always had plenty of money, began to
be short of funds.</p>

<p>“Danny was as miserable as—well, as Danny would be
in a mess like that. She remembered this place, and
begged Gaby to come here, and rest a while, and get rid
of this Bauermont, and the other hangers-on, and get
ready to make a fresh start. You know, a clean start.
Dan says Gaby had real ability as an actress; and that
she could have easily found a position in some stock
company in the United States. Gaby wouldn’t listen to
Danny’s plan of coming here. But, once or twice, she used
the idea as a threat to make this Bauermont bird come
to terms. He wouldn’t come. Later, Gaby began to give
him some of his own blackmailing medicine. I guess he
was pretty keen to get rid of her. And her having talked
about the Desert Moon gave him his idea.</p>

<p>“He showed up one night with a letter from Canneziano,
written from San Quentin. Bauermont was old
enough, by the way, to have been Gaby’s father. He
and Canneziano had been pals here in the United States;
and had gotten together again, three years ago, when
Bauermont had been over here for six months. The
letter, which had been forwarded all over this country
and half of Europe, said only that he was to leave prison
on the fourth of July, and wanted to know where he could
meet Bauermont shortly after that date. Probably all
Canneziano wanted was to renew his old connections;
but the letter was cryptic enough for Bauermont to make
his story out of it.</p>

<p>“A cock-and-bull yarn about how he and Canneziano
had held up that Tonopah mail train, three years ago—the
train that was carrying a big shipment of currency
for the federal reserve bank. A hundred thousand dollars,
wasn’t it? We all remember it, I guess. The robbers got
away. Well, this Bauermont bird told the girls that he
and Canneziano had been the robbers.</p>

<p>“It seems he made a pretty fair story out of it—how
he and Canneziano had decided that every bank in the
country would have the numbers of the bills by morning,
and how they’d agreed to cache them in some safe place
for a rather long time. They’d thought it best, too, to
part company. So Bauermont went on to Salt Lake, and
Canneziano, since we were handy, came and hid the
money here on the ranch.”</p>

<p>Sam interrupted. “Like hell he did!”</p>

<p>“No, of course he didn’t, dad. I’m giving you
Bauermont’s story, that’s all. According to him Canneziano
hid the money here. He was to have joined Bauermont in
Salt Lake, but he got scared and went south instead, to
’Frisco. He’d been there only a few weeks, when he got
pinched for running a gambling hall and sent up for three
years.</p>

<p>“Bauermont went to see him after he was in prison.
He told Bauermont that he had hidden the money here,
all right; but he would not tell him where. He said it was
safe, that no one could find it—not in a thousand years.
That was all Bauermont could get out of him, except a
promise to meet him, when he got out of prison, and come
here with him to get the money.</p>

<p>“You, anyone, can see that the whole story is as full of
holes as a sieve. I don’t understand how Gaby ever fell
for it. Danny will believe most anything anyone tells her.
She is so honest herself, she thinks everyone else is honest.
You can imagine how this plan, of coming here to get
the money, went against the grain with her. But she was
so desperate about Gaby, and the rottenness there, that
she was willing to accept any plan to get Gaby away from
it.”</p>

<p>“I thought we could not find the money,” Danny
supplemented. “Though John says I believe anything,
someway I never did fully believe that story. I never
believed anything, really, that Lewis said. It was the
only chance I had to get Gaby away from there—and I
took it, on the principle, you know, of solving one
problem at a time.”</p>

<p>“Well,” John said, “that’s that. The letter Gaby got,
a few days ago, was from this Bauermont. Danny could
not read the code, but she has every reason to think that
the copy Gaby read to her was genuine. In it he said
that the whole thing, from start to finish, had been a
put up job on Gaby. He and Canneziano had been in
Denver at the time, had read all the accounts of the
train robbery in the papers, and had kicked themselves
to think that they hadn’t been smart enough to have
pulled it off themselves. But they had not; had had no
connection with the affair. The point of it was, that he
had found another girl, was tired of Gaby, and wanted
to ship her out of the way. Danny says the whole thing
was an insult, from beginning to end; and that it seemed
to have been written with no other motive than a desire
to humiliate Gaby, twit her—laugh in her face.”</p>

<p>“Sounds fishy to me,” Sam mused. “If this fellow
wanted to be shed of her, seems as if the best thing he
could have done was to keep his mouth shut, and keep
her here, hunting the hidden treasure until the end of
time.”</p>

<p>“I think,” Danny answered, “that he thought Gaby
might grow tired of searching, and return to him. Lewis
knew that father was to be released, and that he and
Gaby might meet at any time, and Gaby would then
learn the truth. Lewis is mean and cruel. He wanted the
zest—if you can possibly understand—of writing that
cruel, wicked letter.”</p>

<p>“See here,” Sam said. “Suppose, after writing it, he
got scared of what he had done. Gaby, you know, was—well,
she was a pretty violent girl. He might have thought
it over, and decided that it would be a lot safer to have
her clear out of the way. Or, more likely, before he ever
wrote that letter, he might have made arrangements with
some one of his gang over here to come up and put her
out of the way, shortly after she’d got the letter——”</p>

<p>“I move,” Hubert Hand interrupted, “that we all
adjourn, and go to hunt for the secret staircase and the
concealed passage-way.”</p>

<p>“Trying to be funny?” Sam asked, with a bright blue
glare.</p>

<p>“Not at all. But the secret staircase is all that is
lacking, isn’t it? We’ve begun with the buried treasure, we’ve
got the motive, and the international band of organized
criminals. Slick. All there. Romantic and thrilling as you
please. Only, it is a long way from Switzerland to Nevada
and the key in Mary’s pocket.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX. <br> An Accusation</h2>

<p>“Damn the key in Mary’s pocket!” Sam exploded.
“I’m beginning to think I was right, at first, when
I said that Mary locked the door, absent mindedly, and
dropped the key in her pocket herself.”</p>

<p>I judged that I could wait until my turn came to
mention that the key in my pocket was the old pass-key,
and not the key to the attic door. In the next minute I
wished that I had not waited, but had told it so that
Sam might have busied his mind with that.</p>

<p>“Well, John,” he said, “does that finish up the part
of the story Danny couldn’t tell?”</p>

<p>“I think so, dad.”</p>

<p>“All right. Now, Danny, what did you mean, a few
minutes ago, when you warned me to be careful, like you
did?”</p>

<p>“I—” Danny stammered, “—wanted you to be
careful about what you said, in anger.”</p>

<p>“In other words, you wanted me to be careful about
saying anything that would seem to implicate John?”</p>

<p>She did not answer.</p>

<p>“If John was guilty,” Sam insisted, “would you want
him to go scot free?”</p>

<p>“John is not guilty.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?”</p>

<p>“I know it in the same way that you all seem to know
that Chad was not guilty. I know John.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right. But you can’t know John’s innocence
like we know Chad’s; because, from the time Gaby
came downstairs, until we all set out to look for her,
Chad was not out of my sight. He was at the piano. He
walked to the barn with me. He stayed in the barn with
me. He walked back to the house with me. He was with
us all during supper.”</p>

<p>“You,” said Danny, “say that Chad was in the barn
with you during all of that hour. I wonder whether Chad,
if he were alive, could swear that you were in the barn
with him, during all of that hour?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean by that, my girl?” Sam
questioned.</p>

<p>Danny sat and stared at him, her eyes wide, her lips
bitten tight; sat and looked as if she were frightened
plumb out of her senses, and did not say one word.</p>

<p>“You meant something when you said that,” Sam
insisted. “Now what was it? Come, speak up.”</p>

<p>It was no way for him to talk to her, feeling as she felt,
and her sister not yet in her grave. I was downright
ashamed for him. I guess the others felt as I did, for
Hubert Hand said, “Never mind. Lay off that, Sam.
What do you expect to get from an hysterical girl. You
don’t deserve it; you let me down flat; but, just to prove
that I’m a white man, I’ll say that I know you were in
the barn all the time. Of course, if I wasn’t there, my
testimony for you wouldn’t amount to much. But you
know damn well I was there; and I know damn well that
you were. So let up on the little lady. Mary’s turn, next,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Hold on!” Sam said. “Since Danny’s gone this far,
she shouldn’t grudge an extra word or two. Come, now,
Danny. I don’t aim to treat you mean, and you know
I’m sorry for you, and feel for you in your trouble. But
what is it you have on your mind?”</p>

<p>She sat there, still as a mouse; her big eyes growing
bigger from fright.</p>

<p>I guess there is some of the brute in every man. I had
never before suspected that Sam Stanley had his share.</p>

<p>“You’ll have to talk when this case comes to court,”
he said. “It will come to court—don’t forget that. Just
now, it looks as if John were going to have to come up
for trial. Your silence does him a sight more harm than
good; you should know that.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” she exclaimed, short and sharp, as if it hurt her.
“It isn’t John I am trying to shield. I am—I am trying
to save his happiness for him, that’s all. His happiness,
and my own.”</p>

<p>“Just now,” John said, gently, “isn’t the time to be
thinking about our happiness, Danny. If you have
anything to say—please say it.”</p>

<p>“You won’t blame me?” she pleaded. “You won’t
blame me, afterwards?”</p>

<p>“Could I blame you for telling what you think is the
truth?”</p>

<p>“Hubert,” she spoke suddenly, and very sharply, for
her, “did you see Uncle Sam, all that time, in the barn?
Could you see him, all the time, while you were milking
the cows? He says he could not see you.”</p>

<p>“No——” Hubert hesitated. “No—I guess I didn’t
see him, all the time. He was at one end of the barn, and
I was at the other. But I heard him talking to Chad all
the time. They were kidding back and forth. Sam baiting
Chad along; you know how they do—did. Sam was
right there all the time, Danny. No getting away from
that.”</p>

<p>“But there is,” she said. “You all seem to have
forgotten it, but Chad was a mimic and a ventriloquist. He
could have stayed there in the barn alone, and with no
trouble at all, made you think that Uncle Sam was there,
too, and that they were talking together.”</p>

<p>I stopped breathing. I think the others stopped breathing.
Their breaths would have sounded noisy in that
silence. John spoke first.</p>

<p>“Four cows got milked. Chad couldn’t milk. He never
milked a cow in his life.”</p>

<p>“How do you know?” Danny said, and I was surprised
that she should oppose John like that. “You know only
that Chad said he could not milk. We all know that he
was lazy. He was raised on a farm——”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” John echoed her own words.</p>

<p>“I don’t know it. He told me that he was.”</p>

<p>John said: “He told me that he was born and reared
in Chicago.”</p>

<p>“Shut up, John,” Sam commanded. “Go on, Danny.”</p>

<p>“That’s all,” she said. “Except, that if Chad could
milk, that would have given Uncle Sam nearly all of that
hour——”</p>

<p>“Dan!” John’s voice sounded as if he were talking
to one of his meanest broncos. “Stop it! Sitting here and
accusing dad, with no evidence—nothing but a crazy,
wild idea——”</p>

<p>“That is not true. I have evidence. I picked up Gaby’s
bag from the steps yesterday evening. Tobacco and pipe
ashes were sticking to it. Only a few. I think someone had
tried to brush them off, hurriedly, as a man might, and
had made a poor job of it. No one else on this place
smokes a pipe. No one else, anywhere, drops his pipe
whenever he is excited.” She turned to me. “That is
what I told you I dared not tell——” She hid her face
in her hands.</p>

<p>Sam’s pipe fell from his mouth.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch31">

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI. <br> The Session Ends</h2>

<p>It seemed to me that, when Sam’s pipe hit the floor,
it made a noise like doom cracking. We all sat still as
stones. I suppose it could not have been more than a
minute, but it seemed a long time before John left
Danny’s side and went and picked up the pipe and handed it
to Sam.</p>

<p>“It’s all right, dad,” he said.</p>

<p>“Not by a damn sight, it’s not all right,” Sam came
back to his senses vigorously. “But it is interesting—this
thing. It is getting interesting, anyway. Let me see—— If
I had got Chad to help me—and I could have, by telling
him it was some joke or other I had on hand—I could
have sneaked out of the barn, met her and killed her,
during that hour. When could I have got the body
upstairs, though? That’s the first missing link. My reason
for killing her would be another, but——”</p>

<p>“Say! See here, dad,” John cut in.</p>

<p>“You shut up, son. We are waiting to hear the rest of
what Danny has to say. Come, Danny, can you supply
either of those missing links?”</p>

<p>“No,” she said, and sighed. It was easy to see that she
was plumb tuckered out. “No, of course I can’t.”</p>

<p>“If,” Sam went on, seemingly talking entirely to himself,
“if I’d hurried like blazes, I might have done the
deed, and carried her into the house during the time I
was absent from the barn. I’d have had to pass Mary in
the kitchen—I’d have been bound to sneak in the back
way—but, if I asked her not to, more than likely Mary
wouldn’t tell on me. Or, I might have had a hireling
(that’s what they call them, isn’t it? There’s another
word, something like—marmot—no, never mind.) on the
outside, who would have toted the body in for me, while
we were at supper.”</p>

<p>Written out, that sounds as if Sam had been trying to
be comical. He was not at all. He was sitting there, speaking
his thoughts for all to hear, making out a case against
himself, cool as Christmas. For my part, I had heard
enough of it.</p>

<p>“Sam, you look here——” I began.</p>

<p>“You shut up, too, Mary,” Sam said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker spoke. She had her say out. Nobody, not
even Sam, would any more think of telling Mrs. Ricker
to shut up, than they would think of telling any other
dumb object, that suddenly started to talk, to shut up.
Leading a life of silence, I thought, certainly did have its
advantages, at times.</p>

<p>“I think,” Mrs. Ricker said, “that the girl herself
probably killed her sister. If Sam’s pipe ashes were on the
bag, she put them there, afterwards, to make trouble for
him.”</p>

<p>Sam said, “Shucks!”</p>

<p>I thought John would be the first to speak. I was
mistaken.</p>

<p>It was Danny herself who said, “Make her talk, now,
Uncle Sam. Don’t wait for her turn. I—can’t bear it.
Make her talk now, and give her reasons for saying such
a cruel, wicked, lying thing.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ricker,” Sam put the question very solemnly,
“have you any reasons for making this accusation?”</p>

<p>“My only reason is, that I believe it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t beat around the bush. Why do you believe it?”</p>

<p>“I have a feeling that she is guilty.”</p>

<p>“This,” Sam said, sternly, “is no time for feeling, nor
for quibbling. You made a serious accusation—straight
out. I want your reason, or reasons, for making it, and I
want them just as straight.”</p>

<p>“I have no reasons,” Mrs. Ricker said. “That is why
I suspect her.”</p>

<p>“Ah-ah-ah! Women!” Sam said; and the way he said
it, it was the blackest oath he had used that day.</p>

<p>I looked at Danny. I had not been feeling any too
kindly toward her, for the past few minutes; but, just the
same, seeing her there, white and pitiful, with her hands
caught up to her throat, and with the echo of Sam’s
last blasphemy still in my ears, I had a woman feeling
toward her. I knew then, as I know now, that Danielle
Canneziano could no more have killed Gaby than she
could have created her.</p>

<p>“I think,” I said, talking fast to keep Sam from shutting
me up before I could get anything said, “that if, in
suspicioning an innocent girl like Danny, Mrs. Ricker is
simply drawing on her woman’s instinct, she’d better
pass it up, for the present, and listen to some plain
sexless sense.</p>

<p>“Gaby came downstairs at four. Danny called after
her, right then; so Danny was in the house right then.
Gaby went to the rabbit hutch and stopped long enough
to give Martha the bracelet. Almost as soon as Martha
was in the house with the bracelet, Danny was downstairs
with us, cool, collected, and undisturbed. Now
suppose, as an idiot suggested this morning, that Gaby
had come straight back into the house. I guess everyone
would agree that it would take her five minutes to get
back upstairs. That would leave Danny not more than
ten minutes to kill her, and to come downstairs, as I’ve
said, collected and undisturbed. Come to think of it,
Gaby could not have talked to Martha and got to the
attic stairway in any five minutes. At the widest figuring,
that leaves Danny about five minutes——”</p>

<p>As I had been fearing he would, Sam stopped me.
“That’s all right, too, Mary. But there is no need to
draw so long a bow. No need to count minutes on Danny.
The note in Gaby’s bag fixes her innocence better than
all the minutes on the clock could.”</p>

<p>“No, it does not,” Mrs. Ricker said. “Gaby knew that
she had reason to fear an enemy. She probably found
that out from the code letter. She may never have
suspected that the enemy was her own sister.”</p>

<p>“I wish I knew,” Sam said, giving Mrs. Ricker a long
look, “what you are getting at, Mrs. Ricker. I’d give
that,” Sam dangled out his right hand, “to know what
any one of you was getting at. You, for instance, know
that Danny did not kill her sister. I think that Hand
knows that John didn’t do it—maybe not. I’m beginning
to suspect him of honesty in this; but a damn mistaken
honesty, at that. I think that John knows that Chad is as
innocent as—as—a new born babe, as Mary says. I
think Danny would have to be pretty hard put to it,
before she’d invent that story about my pipe ashes——”</p>

<p>“Dad,” John said, and high time he was saying
something, “Dan didn’t invent any story. I know that she
was clear off about the pipe ashes, and I think she
shouldn’t have made such a mistake. Since they couldn’t
have been there, she couldn’t have seen them. But Danny
doesn’t lie. She thought she saw the ashes there, or she
would not have said so.”</p>

<p>“All right, son,” Sam conceded. “I’d a heap rather
think that than not. But, see here, did anyone else think
they saw my pipe ashes around there?”</p>

<p>I looked into my own blue voile lap. I imagined I could
feel Hubert Hand’s eyes boring into me. My face burned.
I could feel the waves of red going up into my scalp and
spreading out around my ears. I prayed a quick, private
prayer to the Lord. But I have learned, through the
years, that trying to instruct the Lord, through the
pretense of prayer, is a supreme impudence that he usually
punishes pretty promptly. My face burned hotter than
ever. I raised my eyes. Sam was staring straight at me.</p>

<p>“Mary,” he said, “you found the body. Did you see
pipe ashes there, then?”</p>

<p>My only excuse is, that it takes longer than a minute
or two minutes to betray a person who has been your
best friend for twenty-five years.</p>

<p>I said, “No.”</p>

<p>“I am going to ask you to swear to that. Somebody
get the Bible.”</p>

<p>Nobody moved.</p>

<p>“You haven’t made any of the others swear to
anything,” I said.</p>

<p>“I haven’t caught any of the others in what I was sure
was a direct and deliberate lie.”</p>

<p>I felt weaker than filtered water. It is one thing to tell
a lie, offhand into the free air. I haven’t much use for a
person who can’t do that, when absolutely necessary.
It is another thing to put your hand on the Good Book
and swear to a lie. I knew that I could not do it.</p>

<p>“Martha,” Sam said, “run and get the Bible for dad.”</p>

<p>Martha seemed to be sound asleep again. I did not
notice anything queer about her appearance. Mrs. Ricker
must have noticed something queer. She jumped to her
feet and dashed across the room to where Martha was
lying. A shriek went piercing through the house,
splintering the air into quivering bits of agony.</p>

<p>Everyone has wakened from sleep, cold with the sweating
terror of some hideous nightmare, but with only the
vaguest impressions of its detail. So it is with me, and that
nightmare hour. I can not reconstruct it. It remains, yet,
in my mind as nothing but a horror of confusions.</p>

<p>We all ran about. I know that there was telephoning.
That some of us made desperate attempts with restoratives.
I remember Sam’s crying, with his face uncovered,
like a child. I can hear him saying that he had given her
the sleeping powder, had forced it upon her. I can hear,
plainest of all, Mrs. Ricker’s voice, with all the pent up
passions of years breaking forth in torrents of heartbreak.</p>

<p>“My baby. My baby girl. My darling. Mother’s life.
Mother’s heart. Speak to mother. My lamb. My baby . . .”</p>

<p>Her voice again, but cruel now, as she shrieks at
Hubert Hand. “Stand there, you beast! Stand there, dry
eyed and look at your dead daughter. The child you
deserted. The child you ignored——”</p>

<p>I remember the feeling of the fresh air as I walked
beside Sam, who was carrying Martha, out of the house.
I think that it was John who explained to me that the
doctor, who had left Telko, was going to meet us on the
road, in order to save time. We must have walked slowly,
but I can not rid myself of the impression of Mrs. Ricker,
running beside us. I remember her scream, when—futile,
unnecessary horror—Sam stumbled with his burden as
he went to step into the sedan.</p>

<p>As the car went dashing away, I remember looking
out of its windows at the house—the great structure, with
its wide expanses and its towers; and it seemed to me that
it looked like some monster, crouching there in the
green; some grim, horrible monster, waiting for its
victims. Three of us had been caught in its clutches. Were
any of us to escape?</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch32">

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII. <br> A Part of the Past</h2>

<p>The doctor, who was younger and more cruel than
even a doctor has a right to be, said that Martha
had died from a stoppage of the heart, undoubtedly
induced by the strong drug in the sleeping powder that
had been administered. In other words, Sam had killed
her. He loved her. How deeply he had loved her, none of
us had ever had sense enough to realize.</p>

<p>We had her funeral, and Chad’s, two days later. They
were buried in the second grove of aspen trees, two miles
beyond the cabin. All the people in the valley came. At
first, I thought that they had come to honor the dead, and
Sam. But, as I stood by the graves, and watched the faces
about me, faces that held suspicion, horror, curiosity;
sly faces, cruel faces, eager faces, I did not care to think
why most of them had come.</p>

<p>Sam noticed it, too. For, though I had not said a word
to him, as we walked home from the graves, he said to
me, “Don’t blame them, Mary. What else could we
expect? Decency breeds decency, and—filth draws filth.”</p>

<p>There were only four of us around the table that evening.
Mrs. Ricker had gone straight to her room, after the
funeral. Danny, with no protest from Sam, had left the
day before to take Gaby’s body to San Francisco. It had
seemed heartless to allow her to go alone; but I could
not be spared, and there was no one else to go with her.
John might have gone; but Danny refused to allow him
to, saying, unselfishly, that Sam needed John more than
she needed him.</p>

<p>“You people,” Hubert Hand spoke suddenly, to John
and Sam and me, as we sat there, looking at a supper
that nobody pretended to eat, “have been awfully decent
about not asking questions since the other afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I’m done with questions,” Sam said. “Through.
Finished.”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” Hubert Hand replied, “there are a
lot of answers that are going to have to be given, sooner
or later. You heard Mrs. Ricker say that I was Martha’s
father——”</p>

<p>“Never mind that, now, Hand,” Sam interrupted.
“I’ve known, since the first week you came to the ranch,
that there was, or had been, something between you two.
You’d been her lover, I suppose. Well—men do. That’s
all. I never went around thinking you, nor any man, was
a plaster saint. I reckon you deserted her, eh? And treated
her like hell, generally. And she found a refuge here.
And, later, probably, heard that you were in trouble, and
sent you a letter and told you to come here. Put you wise
about the chess racket. Helped you. Made a refuge for
you. Women do.</p>

<p>“I suppose she slipped poor Martha in, in place of the
child she’d got from the orphanage—used the same
papers. Well—to keep on repeating myself, mothers do.
You and she have both lived straight and acted decent
for the years you’ve been here. If the two of you want
to keep on living in this hell-hole, and keep on straight
and acting decent, you’ll get the same treatment from me
you’ve always got. If you are Martha’s parents, that’s
more reason, not less, for my not wanting to break up
our family here, or make trouble for either one of you.”</p>

<p>Hubert Hand pushed back his chair, got up, and
walked to the window. “By God, but you’re a white man,
Sam!” he said. “You’re so damn white that you make
every one around you look yellow as sulphur by contrast.</p>

<p>“You’ve got it doped out right about Ollie Ricker and
me. She was twelve years older than I was—I always felt
like that was kind of an excuse for me. Guess not, though.
She was a good enough girl until I came along, just out of
prison, and as rotten as two years in prison can make a
kid. That’s pretty damn rotten. I shouldn’t have been
sent up, that time. Nothing but a kid’s trick—grand row
in a dump down on Barbary Coast.</p>

<p>“My mother was dead. My dad was a high-hatter.
He went back on me, cold, after that. Found my room
locked when I went home. I went back to Ollie. She kept
me pretty straight for a while. I ought to have married
her, and I know it, before the kid was born. But she was
so jealous that she made life a living hell for me. I—well,
I wouldn’t marry her.</p>

<p>“It was her fault that I got sent up the second time.
She talked to a girl friend of hers, and the girl snitched.
Up to that time, I think that Ollie Ricker talked more
than any living woman. She took a vow, the day they
got me, that she’d never speak an unnecessary word
again in her life. I’ll say she’s kept that vow pretty well.
I wish to God I’d taken the same vow, before I shot my
mouth off about John, the other day.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think that I did it, then?” I wished John
could have seemed less eager.</p>

<p>“On the square,” Hubert answered, “I don’t see who
else could have done it. That makes no never minds. I
wish I’d kept my mouth shut, on account of Sam——”</p>

<p>“Leave me out of it,” Sam growled, “and forget it.
Forget the whole damn thing, if you can. I’m through.
If I hadn’t been so busy playing the fool while Martha
was dying, we could likely have saved her. We’ll never
get any place with this thing. Nobody will. Look at us,
messing around with a lot of damn fool clues, and
suspicions, telling one lie to cover another—like a batch
of gossiping old grannies, while Martha was lying there,
dying. And me growling and snarling at her all afternoon.
I’m a fool. I’m a damn sight worse—I’m an old fool. A
girl got killed on the Desert Moon Ranch. A boy killed
himself for love of her. The killer got clean away. So
far as I’m concerned, it is going to rest there. I’m closing
the book. Soon as I can, I’ll sell out the damn place, lock,
stock and barrel.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t go for me, dad,” John said. “And I
think you’ll change your mind. I’m not willing to go on
the rest of my life with half a dozen people thinking that
I killed Gabrielle. No sir, not with one person thinking it.
Hubert Hand seems to be in a sort of sentimental mood,
right now. How long’s he going to stay that way? When
he gets over it, what’s he going to do with the club he has
in his hand? Nothing? Maybe. Depends on how much he
might need some cash, sometime in the future.”</p>

<p>Hubert said, “I’m no damn blackmailer.”</p>

<p>“What did you serve your second term in prison for?”</p>

<p>“None of your business.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“No. Hold on, I’ll tell you. It’s up to me to tell things
to-day, and I’m telling them. It was forgery, all right;
but, just the same, I don’t feel, yet, like I was much to
blame. I’d gotten in with a rotten crowd, and——”</p>

<p>“Never mind. Let it go at that. Here’s another thing,
dad. Danny honestly believes that, someway or other,
you are mixed up in this thing. We can’t marry, with a
thing like that between us. I guess it doesn’t make any
difference in the way we feel toward each other; but it
makes a barrier, just the same, that will have to come
down before we marry. I haven’t talked it over, exactly,
with Dan, but I’m dead certain she feels the same way I
do about it.”</p>

<p>“You think Danny is coming back here, then?”
Hubert questioned.</p>

<p>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I’m not looking for her to come back—that’s all.”</p>

<p>“You’re crazy with the heat. They read a telegram to
me, not an hour ago, saying that she’d get in on number
Twenty-one Friday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet she’s not on it.”</p>

<p>“Say, Hand——”</p>

<p>“Keep your shirt on, John. We all know that Danny is
innocent of the crime, and that she is a good little scout—a
lot better than Gaby was, if not half as charming and
attractive. But—she knows more than she wishes to know.
She knows more than she’s going to tell. Maybe more
than she can tell, in safety. For the love of Mike,
folks—couldn’t you see that she had some reason for working up
that case against Sam? Cutting it out of whole cloth. If
she’d been trying to shield John, do you think she’d have
used Sam for that purpose? Not on your life she wouldn’t
have, she’d have pinned it on me, or Mrs. Ricker, or even
on Mary. She did try to pin it on Chad——”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker came tottering into the room. Sam jumped
to meet her, and helped her over to his own big chair at
the head of the table.</p>

<p>She leaned forward, her long black-sleeved arms
stretched straight in front of her over the white cloth, her
hands clenched into fists.</p>

<p>“For hours,” she said, “I have been trying to reach
a decision. I have reached it. I have come here to
confess.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII. <br> Another Confession</h2>

<p>“Before I came to the Desert Moon——” she began,
but Hubert Hand stopped her.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Ollie. No need confessing, as you say,
any of that. Sam knows all about us. He’d guessed it, or
most of it, years ago. I’ve just now told him the rest. It
is all right with him. I mean—he realizes it’s all long
past. He thinks, as I do, that the best thing we can do is
to forget it; and, as he says, keep on living straight and
decent.”</p>

<p>“Do you know all of our story?” Mrs. Ricker lifted
her faded eyes to Sam.</p>

<p>“Enough,” Sam sort of sighed it. “I don’t care about
details. All but—I was kind of wondering what became
of the brown-eyed baby, named Vera, who the papers
from the orphanage were made out for.”</p>

<p>“I found her a home with the mother and father of one
of the nurses in the hospital. They thought that she was
my own child. They loved her, and were kind to her.
Until she died, during the influenza epidemic in San
Francisco, in 1918, I sent half of my salary to them, for
her, each month.”</p>

<p>“I always knew you were a good woman,” Sam said.
“Now what do you say we forget it, let by-gones be
by-gones?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Mrs. Ricker. “Martha did not kill Gaby,
as you think she did, Sam. I killed her.”</p>

<p>Sam dropped his pipe.</p>

<p>There was another one of those dead, awful silences.</p>

<p>“The guilt,” Mrs. Ricker went on, “is entirely mine.
All of my life I have been cursed with an abnormal
jealousy, and with the violent temper that usually
accompanies such jealousy. Martha, you all know,
possessed both of these traits—a heritage from her
mother—without the balancing power of an adult mind.”
She turned to Hubert Hand. “Have you told about Nina
Ziegelman?”</p>

<p>“No,” he spoke sharply. “I wouldn’t, Ollie. No
need——”</p>

<p>“But I would,” she said, and continued, more rapidly.
“About four months before Martha was born a woman
named Nina Ziegelman betrayed us—Hubert and me.
I had given her a confidence, and she betrayed it. When
I found what she had done I went to her hotel room
and tried to kill her. I did not succeed. I shot her; but she
recovered. For many reasons, of their own, she and her
friends proffered no charges against me. I went free.
But I had marked Martha for murder. She was powerless
against it; as powerless as she would have been
against any evil physical inheritance. She can’t be
blamed. No one could dare blame her for that. It was I,
who planted those seeds of violence, jealousy, hatred,
and murderous intent, who killed Gabrielle. Martha was
only the helpless instrument.”</p>

<p>I was sorry that there was eagerness, mixed with the
pity in John’s voice, as he asked, “Did Martha tell you
that she committed the murder?”</p>

<p>“No. Other parental heritages of hers were a lying
tongue, and slyness. She persisted in her denials, to me.
But it is all so evident.</p>

<p>“Gabrielle joined Martha at the rabbit hutch. You
know how one sits down on one’s heels to peer in at the
rabbits in the low hutch. I think Gaby must have been
squatting, so, when Martha jumped at her and
overpowered her. Martha was strong, you know. Her hands
were very strong. You remember, Mary, how she could
open fruit jars that neither you nor I could budge? She
had hated Gaby ever since Gaby had come. Martha had
said to me, dozens of times, that someday she thought
she would kill Gaby.</p>

<p>“The marks on her throat, I thought, and so did the
coroner, looked as if she had been caught by someone
who had been standing behind her. Seized unawares, it
would not take long to strangle a person. Martha must
have done it in two or three minutes. She took the
bracelet then, rolled the body under the clump of berry
bushes, right there, and came straight into the house.</p>

<p>“She showed no feeling of guilt, because she had none.
At that moment, we should all have suspected something.
We should have known that girl would not, suddenly,
have given Martha the bracelet. Later, she told
you about it, didn’t she, Sam? And you left Chad in the
barn, to hoodwink Hubert, and came up and hid the
body for her?”</p>

<p>“By God, I did not,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“No need to deny it, now, Sam,” she said. “It was the
deed of a good man. Martha was never responsible—but
courts might not have understood. Now we will all shield
her—keep her secret. Chad’s confession will satisfy the
world. Danny must know, I suppose; but no one else
need ever know——”</p>

<p>“But I tell you——” Sam shouted.</p>

<p>I don’t know how, without raising her voice, she made
it sound through his shouting, and silence it, but she did.
“Sam—don’t. Why can’t we be honest, now, among
ourselves? You see, I know that both you and Martha were
on those stairs when the body was put there——”</p>

<p>My thoughts jumped out into words. “Chad must have
known it, too. He must have decided that he’d rather die
than betray either Sam or Martha.”</p>

<p>“He might have thought it,” Sam said, with a lack of
emphasis that edged stupidity. “He could not have
known it. It is not true.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ricker,” John questioned, “what makes you
think that dad and Martha had both been on the stairs?”</p>

<p>“Sam’s pipe ashes were strewn about. And there was
an old tatting shuttle, with which I had been trying to
teach Martha to tat, that morning. She had it in her
pocket. It must have dropped out. I think that Mary
tried to clean the pipe ashes away. They were gone when
I saw the body the second time. I should have tried to do
it, but I didn’t think. I had no time. I was frantic with
fear.</p>

<p>“Wait,” she answered our looks and our exclamations
of astonishment. “I will explain. Martha and I, as you
know, were alone here in the house while the rest of you
were out looking for Gaby. Martha was sleepy. I was
worried about her sleeping so much, and tried all sorts
of ways to keep her awake until bed time. I kept sending
her out to look at the sky, to see whether a storm was
coming to spoil her fireworks. She would run out, and
right in again, to curl on the davenport and try to sleep.
Finally, though, she stayed outside, for a long time. But
for Sam’s pipe ashes, I would think that then she had
managed to drag the body upstairs by herself. Still—though
I believe that she did have strength enough to
move the body, I do not believe that she would have had
wits enough.</p>

<p>“When the wind rose, I looked first for Martha. I
called her several times before she answered. Finally
she came around the house from the direction of the
rabbit hutch, again. Surely, you must have noticed, as I
did, that she had seemed strangely excited during all the
late afternoon and early evening. At the time, I thought
it was because she had been given the monkey charm, and
because she was to have the fireworks.</p>

<p>“But, when we were alone, she talked very foolishly—even
for her. She began with it again, when she had
answered my call. She kept insisting that soon we were
all going to be surprised about something; something very
nice, that had to do with Chad—but she would never,
never tell what it was. As a rule, I should not have paid
any attention to such talk. But, for some reason, her
excitement, and her insistence about a surprise,
disturbed me. I spent some minutes quizzing her. I even
tried to bribe her. I could get nothing from her but
further talk about the nice surprise.</p>

<p>“At last I gave it up, and ran upstairs to begin closing
the house against the storm. I thought I’d begin with the
attic, and come down through the house. I tried the
attic door. It was locked, and the key was missing. I was
alarmed. Possibly, because we were all disturbed
concerning Gaby’s absence; and possibly, because inside
doors are so seldom locked here. I remembered the old
skeleton key hanging in the broom closet. I ran down and
got it.</p>

<p>“I opened the door. I saw the body. I touched it—and
knew, even before I saw the tatting shuttle there, and
the beaded bag, covered with Sam’s pipe ashes. I snatched
the shuttle and hid it in my dress. At that instant,
through the open window at the end of the hall, I heard
your voices, as you ran up the road from the garage to
escape the rain. I shut the door, locked it, and ran
downstairs. Do you know, when I met you, I had that key in
my hand?</p>

<p>“Mary came up to me to help me close the French
windows. I did not think. I had a wild desire to rid
myself of that key. I was determined to protect Martha, at
any cost. Mary’s pocket was hanging like an open bag,
right below me. I dropped the key into it. It was a
frightful mistake. If I had kept it, and thrown it away,
everyone in the house would have been exonerated. It
was, as you know, the one link that connected this
household with the crime. That is, after Mary had cleaned
away the pipe ashes. The little fleck or two of them, which
Danny saw, might have fallen there days before——”</p>

<p>“Mary,” Sam questioned, “were my pipe ashes on the
bag? Did you stop to clean them off, before you gave the
alarm?”</p>

<p>“Yes, they were, Sam. Yes, I did.”</p>

<p>“Then,” Sam said, “whoever put the body there, put
the pipe ashes there to throw suspicion on me; and
whoever it was, knew my habits, too. He must have put the
tatting shuttle there, as well, for good measure. Does
anyone of you think that Martha would have had the wits
to save ashes out of my pipe and put them on the bag?
I tell you, that would take an amount of logic, of
reasoning, that Martha could no more have managed than a
kitten could.”</p>

<p>“Chad!” John almost sang it, in his eagerness. “He
was wise enough, and fool enough. His one idea was to
protect Martha. He helped her get the body up there,
between seven and eight o’clock, and he put the ashes
there to shield her. I said fool enough. But, come to think
of it, he knew what he was doing. He was protecting
her with the one person in the house who could not have
done it; with the one person that no Nevada jury would
convict. Then, he turned around and shielded dad with
his death and his written confession. From start to finish,
it works out, plain as day. Gosh! Say—it is terrible.
Gosh—horrible! Think of it—— But, thank God, it is
cleared up, anyway.”</p>

<p>“ ‘Cleared up, <em>anyway</em>’ is right,” Sam said, and looked
around at all of us, pityingly, like he’d look at a litter of
sickly puppies.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch34">

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV. <br> Defense</h2>

<p>“All satisfied, then?” Sam questioned. “All satisfied
that Martha killed her, and that Chad carried the
body upstairs and hid it for her, and left the false
clues—including the tatting shuttle, for reasons unknown—and
came down, merry and happy enough, until he took a
sudden notion to write a false confession and walk out
and shoot himself through the head?”</p>

<p>I was satisfied; but I felt like a fool for so being, when
Sam put it like that. I said nothing.</p>

<p>Hubert Hand said, “It looks like a pretty clear case,
Sam.”</p>

<p>“Does? What’s become of your clear case against
John, unchanged tires, and everything?”</p>

<p>“I had not heard Ollie’s story, then.”</p>

<p>“Dad,” there was pleading in John’s voice, “you don’t
mean to say that you can’t see the thing? That you aren’t
satisfied with this absolutely logical explanation?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Sam answered, with his most dangerous drawl,
“that’s what I mean to say. It takes more, or seems to,
to satisfy me than it takes to satisfy some folks. Satisfied?
Not by a damn sight!”</p>

<p>John lost his temper. “For the love of Pete, why aren’t
you? What would satisfy you? Say? What are you trying
to do? Do you like the case against me so well that you
can’t give it up? You made us all come clean the other
day, or tried to. Come clean yourself, now? What have
you got up your sleeve?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a couple of good fighting arms up my sleeve,”
Sam answered. “And I’ve got a daughter, dead, in a
grave up there. Since she was knee high to a duck, she’s
counted on me, for food, and shelter, and protection
generally. I don’t know—but I reckon she may still be
counting on me, somewhere not too far away, for
protection. She is going to have it.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker began to cry, quietly; but Sam saw her.</p>

<p>“No, no, Mrs. Ricker,” he said, “don’t get me wrong
in this. You believe that she was guilty. I believe that she
is innocent. Believing that way, it is my bounden duty
to clear her name. It is my fault that she isn’t here to
stand up for herself. It is my fault, too, I guess, that I’ve
raised John so that he won’t stand up for his own
womenfolks——”</p>

<p>“That’s rotten of you, dad. It is unfair. I’d stand up
for Martha till the cows came home. But what’s the use
of bucking straight facts?”</p>

<p>“Damn your straight facts. We haven’t got any. I’ve a
few straight fact questions, though, that will blow this
story galley-west. Here’s one of them:</p>

<p>“Does it stand to reason that, for two months, Gaby
lived right here unharmed by Martha? But that, on the
very day, when she feared death from some outside
enemy, Martha should kill her?”</p>

<p>“It is coincidental,” John admitted. “But, just the
same, there are lots of coincidences. We all meet them,
all the time.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t a coincidence that Gaby was afraid of meeting,
when she walked out of this house on the fourth of
July. Here’s another question.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ricker, she says, was plumb convinced that
Martha committed the murder, and that I helped her by
carrying the body upstairs afterwards. She thought this
the night of the murder, and the next day, and ever
since. Why, then, didn’t she come to me and, anyway, put
out a feeler or two in my direction? She knew that I’d go
as far to save Martha as she would go. I wouldn’t protect
John, nor any other person on this place; but Martha
was a child—younger, even, than a child in some ways.
Mrs. Ricker knew that I’d save Martha with my last
dollar, and, as somebody said the other day, with my
last lie. Mrs. Ricker and I were alone together for more
than half an hour the morning of the fifth. Why didn’t
she give me a hint, then, of any of this?”</p>

<p>“I—I was afraid,” Mrs. Ricker answered. “I was
waiting. I thought that you would give me the
hint—the sign. I was not sure——”</p>

<p>“Not sure then, but sure now?”</p>

<p>“I tell you,” Mrs. Ricker flared up, “I was afraid. So
long as she was living, I was afraid of everything—of
everyone. I was afraid of myself. I dared not think; I
dared not look. I scarcely lifted my eyes from my tatting.
I—I was afraid.”</p>

<p>“Now, now,” Sam said. “I see your point in that,
especially since talking had got you in bad once. But—see
here. I said a while ago that I’d always known you
were a good woman. Well, I am going to keep on knowing
it, for the present. There are enough folks around here to
jump at conclusions without me doing it. But you,
thinking as you say you think, directly accused Danny the
other day. That was not the act of a good woman——”</p>

<p>“God, Ollie!” Hubert Hand burst out. “He is going
to try to pin it on you, to save Martha and the Stanley
name—even yet.”</p>

<p>“You,” Sam said, “are a liar.”</p>

<p>“Safe enough. I wouldn’t fight you, and you know it,
old man.”</p>

<p>Sam jumped to his feet. I had to stumble over John,
but I managed to reach Sam first, and to stand in front
of him. “Boys, boys,” I begged. “Not here. Not in this
house to-night. Remember——”</p>

<p>Hubert stuck his hands in his pockets and walked
away. Sam dropped into his chair. The telephone bell,
in the other room, began to ring.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch35">

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV. <br> A Visitor</h2>

<p>Hubert answered the telephone, and called to Sam.
I followed him into the living-room to hear what
was to be heard. I think that John and Mrs. Ricker
followed for the same reason.</p>

<p>When Sam said, “Read it, please,” I knew that it was
another telegram. They telephone all of our telegrams to
us from Rattail, and mail them later, when they get
around to it, if they don’t forget.</p>

<p>We had been pestered nearly crazy with telegrams,
on account of all the ruckus Sam had stirred up about
Canneziano, on the night of the murder. I supposed this
would be another one of them, about some poor Indian
or other who had been found at a desert water-hole. But,
almost right away, I could tell from Sam’s answers that
this was about something different. He kept writing
things on the telephone pad, and asking central to repeat,
and to repeat again, and to spell that, please. Lands, but I
got nervous, before he finally hung up the receiver, and
turned to us, and asked:</p>

<p>“Any of you ever hear of a fellow named Lynn
MacDonald?”</p>

<p>None of us, of course, ever had.</p>

<p>“Seems he is a kind of detective,” Sam explained. “He
calls himself a crime analyst, and he specializes in
murder cases. Works on his own hook, kind of like Sherlock
Holmes did, I guess. He had a list of references, and past
cases, long as your arm. They sounded fine. I forget them
now. Anyway, he made a straight proposition. He wants
to come here and take the case. He wants his expenses,
and nothing else, if he fails. If he succeeds, he wants ten
thousand, cash. Poor fish, I’d have paid twenty thousand
just as quick. Anyway, that’s a fair proposition. It is the
way I am used to trading; money down if I deliver,
nothing if I don’t. I’m going to wire him to come.”</p>

<p>“Dad,” John objected, “you don’t know a thing about
this guy, except what he tells you. If you have to drag
a detective into this, now, after what Mrs. Ricker has
told us, why don’t you wire to a reputable agency, and
have it send someone?”</p>

<p>“I like the tune this fellow sings. I like the straight
way he made his proposition. When I wanted the best
doctors for Martha, I always got specialists, didn’t I?
Well, this fellow’s a specialist. His references were damn
good. I like his name. An honest Scotchman comes pretty
close to being the noblest work of God.</p>

<p>“Let’s see—Danny is coming up on Friday afternoon,
isn’t she? I’ll wire MacDonald to take the same train.
That will save us two trips to Rattail in the heat.”</p>

<p>“Listen, dad—sleep over it,” John urged.</p>

<p>I hated the quick, sharp way both Sam and Hubert
Hand looked at him. I hated him noticing it, and
jumping right into an explanation.</p>

<p>“If Mrs. Ricker is right about all this,” he said, “and I
swear that I think she is, isn’t it enough for us to know
about it, dad? If you get a detective here, and he comes
to the same conclusion, we can’t keep it a secret, then.”</p>

<p>Sam said, “He won’t. And we aren’t wanting, nor
needing any secrets on the Desert Moon, just now.”</p>

<p>He sat down and began to write the telegram. Five
minutes, and he was reading it to the operator at Rattail.
He had just hung up the telephone receiver when the
doorbell rang, a long, impudent ring.</p>

<p>Nobody, I thought as I went to the door, with any
sense of decency would ring our bell, like that, on this
evening.</p>

<p>I was right. For a minute I did not recognize the man
standing there on the porch. In the next minute I did
recognize him. My heart stood stock still. He was Daniel
Canneziano.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI. <br> Canneziano</h2>

<p>He pushed right past me, into the room, without
waiting for an invitation. He always was a polished-up,
perfumed little fellow, but that evening, what with
his gray spats and a cane, he was right-down dandified.</p>

<p>“Got a chap to drive me up from Rattail,” he said.
“Beastly things, these Ford cars. What?”</p>

<p>He gave that explanation of how he had got up from
Rattail, as if it were the only thing any of us could
possibly be wondering about him, or wanting to know.</p>

<p>“I left my trunk down there,” he went on, taking off
his light gray overcoat, and brushing it, and folding it
across his valise that he had set on a chair. “The Ford
chap couldn’t bring it. I thought you could send a truck
down for it, to-morrow, Sam.”</p>

<p>“Counting on paying us quite a visit, eh, Canneziano?”</p>

<p>Sam found his voice at last. “Trunk and everything.”</p>

<p>“As a matter of fact,” Canneziano answered, sitting
down and making himself comfortable on the small
davenport, “all that mess you stirred up about me, on
the night of the murder, makes traveling not altogether
agreeable for the present. Yes, I think, all things
considered, that having me for a guest, after having set all
the police in the country on my trail, keeping me safely
here, as it were, is about the least you can do, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I reckon I could do a little less, in a pinch,” Sam
drawled. “But, all things considered, as you say—though
it might be you and I aren’t considering the same things—I’m
glad to see you here. Make yourself right at home,
for you may be going to stay even longer than you
planned.”</p>

<p>“Righto! However, if you have some neat little
scheme of trying to pin the murder on me, I’d advise you
to abandon it. If I hadn’t had water-tight alibis, all
along the line——”</p>

<p>“Keep your water-tight alibis in a dry place till you
need them,” Sam advised. “Maybe you will need them.
We’ve got a crime analyst, specialist in murder cases,
coming up here Friday. You can give your alibis to him.”</p>

<p>“That crime analyst sounds like Lynn MacDonald.
That’s what she calls herself.”</p>

<p>“She!” Sam said.</p>

<p>“If you’ve got Lynn MacDonald, you’ve got a
woman.”</p>

<p>“Hell!” Sam exploded.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” Canneziano said, “she’s the best dic
on the coast. Some say that she is the best in this country.
Not that I give a hang. But, this is inside dope, if
anybody can find who killed the Gaby, this MacDonald
woman can. You should hear some of the San Quentin
boys compliment her—in their way.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want a woman. Better wire her not to come,
dad,” John urged.</p>

<p>This time it was Canneziano who looked quickly and
sharply at John. “You’re dead right you had,” he said,
“if you don’t want the murderer discovered.”</p>

<p>“Sam,” Hubert Hand suggested, “you’d better wire
and verify her references, anyway.”</p>

<p>Canneziano laughed. “I see what you are getting at.
I take it you’ve all gotten pretty jumpy around here,
these last few days. Can’t see the woodpile for the
niggers. Now this gentleman—by the by, Sam, you are
forgetting your manners; I have not, as yet, met any of
your guests—thinks that this coming dic may be a pal
of mine; something of the sort. If that were the case,
what good would it do to verify her references, by wire?
The people you wired to would all answer that Lynn
MacDonald was honest, capable, and so forth. She’s got a
reputation around the bay that is hard to beat. But, if
this were a plant, Jane Jones or Amaryllis De Vere could
come along, just the same, posing as Lynn MacDonald.
If you are really concerned about it, why not have a
Burns man bring her up? You shouldn’t mind the extra
expense, Sam.”</p>

<p>“There’s generally more than one way to skin a cat,”
Sam said, “besides the way you are told to do it.”</p>

<p>Leaving us to think that over, he went to the telephone
and called the office of <i>The Morning Record</i>, at Telko,
and asked for Mr. Clarence Pette.</p>

<p>When he finally got him, he asked him whether he
knew Lynn MacDonald. Evidently he said that he knew
who she was, for Sam told him to take number Twenty-one
at Telko, Friday afternoon, and to meet him here,
and he would pay him fifty dollars for his trouble.</p>

<p>“Pretty work, Sam,” Canneziano approved. “Too
bad I got you all so rattled. As a matter of fact, I rather
fancy myself in the rôle of a sleuth. If Lynn MacDonald
weren’t coming, I’d like to take a try at this job myself.
For instance, I noticed that, though Dan is in ’Frisco
now—according to the papers—none of you suggested
that she meet Lynn MacDonald, have her identified, and
bring her back here with her. I am trying to decide
whether that means that you don’t trust the gentle Dan,
or whether, though the newspapers say she is to return
at once to her home in Nevada, you do not expect her to
return.”</p>

<p>“It means neither,” John snapped.</p>

<p>“Mr. Canneziano,” I said, “this is John Stanley,
Sam’s adopted son. He and Danny are engaged to be
married. This other gentleman is Mr. Hubert Hand, and
the lady is Mrs. Ricker.”</p>

<p>Things felt real polite, for a minute, as they always
do just after folks have been introduced.</p>

<p>“Bad times you have been having around here, lately,”
Canneziano said, pleasantly, as if he were talking about
the weather.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker excused herself and went upstairs.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch37">

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII. <br> Strangler Bauermont</h2>

<p>Sam spoke directly to Canneziano. “Did you ever
know a man named Bauermont—Lewis
Bauermont?”</p>

<p>“Strangler Bauermont? Very well indeed. Has he
anything to do with it?”</p>

<p>“What’s that you called him?” Sam asked, sharply.</p>

<p>“Strangler Bauermont, you mean?”</p>

<p>I remembered that Danny had told me his nickname
was “Mexico.”</p>

<p>Sam said, “That’s what I mean. How did he come by a
name like that?”</p>

<p>“He is by way of being a wrestler, I believe; and won
the name for some particularly clever hold that brought
his man down every time. I have never gone in for that
sort of thing—can’t give you scientific details. He was a
jiu-jitsu expert, also. Oh, no, no,” as he noticed our
quickening interests. “He is a continent and an ocean
away, at present. Moreover, murder is quite outside his
line—quite. And he was, I believe, rather smitten than
otherwise with the Gaby.”</p>

<p>“You are sure he is in Europe now?” Sam questioned.</p>

<p>“I had a letter from him, only a few days ago, written
and sent from Deauville. A cable to Scotland Yard would
locate him precisely for you, I have no doubt. Assuming,
of course, that you don’t mind spending a few dollars.”</p>

<p>“I suppose,” Sam mused, “that he could easy teach
his strangling trick to another man.”</p>

<p>“Undoubtedly. But isn’t the entire connection rather
foolish, when one stops to think that Strangler has been,
for years, badly smitten with the lady?”</p>

<p>“I guess he got over that,” Sam said. “Seems, now, as
if he was anxious to be shed of her.”</p>

<p>“Oh-ho! And he famous for his constancy to the Gaby.
Nine, ten, I don’t know how many years. However,
though I’ll grant his name belies it, he was a smooth,
diplomatic cuss. I think you can be practically certain
that he would draw the line at murder—under any
circumstances.”</p>

<p>“That letter you had from him,” Sam said. “I suppose
you destroyed it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t tie my letters into packets bound with blue
ribbons.”</p>

<p>“Was it written in code?”</p>

<p>“No. You see, the hotel where I was putting up just
then was, one might say, over regulated. Letters written
in code were not favorably regarded there.”</p>

<p>“Could you read a letter written in his code?”</p>

<p>“I fancy so. If you have a Spanish dictionary.”</p>

<p>“There was nothing Spanish about this one. It was
just a jumble of letters.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know it then. I’m rather clever with codes,
however. I fancy I could decipher it, with a bit of
study.”</p>

<p>“Do they speak Spanish in Mexico?” I questioned;
and was rewarded by having all present look at me as if
they thought that I had just developed a yearning for
cultural, geographical knowledge.</p>

<p>“I am getting at something,” I explained. “Was this
Bauermont man ever in Mexico?”</p>

<p>“Unfriendly persons,” Canneziano answered,
“insinuate that Mexico is his native land.”</p>

<p>“Did anyone ever call him ‘Mexico’?”</p>

<p>“To his fury, yes. Is it relevant?”</p>

<p>Sam asked, “Where were you, do you know, at the
time of the Tonopah train robbery, three years ago?
You were here, right shortly after that, I seem to
remember.”</p>

<p>“I stopped for a friendly visit, and you kicked me out,
and into my downfall at ’Frisco. My three years in the
big house are at your door. But I hold no grudge.”</p>

<p>“What I want to know is, where were you at the time
of the train robbery?”</p>

<p>“I was in Denver, since you insist.”</p>

<p>“Was this Strangler fellow there with you?”</p>

<p>“He was. Pardon my curiosity, but is this leading to
something?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Do you? This Strangler friend of yours
told the girls that you and he robbed that train.”</p>

<p>Canneziano’s face went dark and ugly. “So the girls
say, ugh?”</p>

<p>“He told them that,” John said. There was threat
enough in his voice to make Canneziano come off his
perch.</p>

<p>“Is that possible?” he questioned, but pleasantly
enough. “I can’t see his motive. As a matter of fact, when
we read the accounts of how easily the thing had been
pulled off, we did rather regret that we had not taken a
try at it ourselves. If he had not included himself in his
confession to the girls, I would think that he had some
friendly reason for preferring me in captivity. . . . No, I
don’t get it.”</p>

<p>“We think he has denied it, since,” Sam said. “We
think that the code letter, which none of us can read, is
his denial. No matter. Your story tots up straight enough
with the one we have.”</p>

<p>“Gratifying, I am sure. I wonder whether I might see
this code letter? As I’ve remarked—I’ve a beastly habit of
bragging, I hope you don’t mind—I am rather clever with
the things.”</p>

<p>I went upstairs to get it. I am not denying that it gave
me the creeps to go into Gaby’s room, alone at night.
When I opened the door, and saw that the light on the
table was lit, and that someone was standing beside it, I
all but jumped out of my shoes.</p>

<p>It was Mrs. Ricker. She turned to me, and apologized,
quietly, for having startled me. “I was looking at these
things,” she went on. “They know. They were there. If
only one of them could talk——”</p>

<p>“I thought,” I am sure I spoke too tartly, “that you
knew. You said that you did.”</p>

<p>“Sam doesn’t believe it,” she answered. “Doesn’t
that give me, her mother, a right to doubt, if I can?”</p>

<p>I was all out of sorts. “It would have been better to
have doubted it, in the first place,” I said.</p>

<p>“I know. But I didn’t—I couldn’t. Sam does. And
then, that man coming into the house to-night—I can’t
explain it; but, someway, he made all of us, even Hubert,
seem so good. The house itself felt, to me—do you
understand?—good. As if any wicked thing would have to come
into it from the outside, from far away, just as he came
into it to-night?”</p>

<p>I did understand. I had had that feeling of drawing
close to the others and away from him, the minute he had
come into the room. But I was so put out with her, for
startling me, and for being in Gaby’s room, anyway,
poking around—though land knows she had a right to be
there, and I might have done the same thing myself, with
my lists of clues, and so on—that I just said I supposed
so, and picked up the letter, at the same time looking
over the other things on the table to be sure nothing was
missing.</p>

<p>“Perhaps,” she said, “I should not have come in here?
I suppose, when the detective comes, he—she would like
to see the room as nearly as possible undisturbed. Do
you think it would be a good plan to lock it, and to give
the key to Sam, until she does come?”</p>

<p>She went around with me, while I locked the doors on
the inside. We had to lock the doors in Danny’s room,
too, since the two rooms had only the curtained doorway
between them. We went into the hall through Danny’s
room. I locked that door after us. She told me good-night
and went to her own room. I went downstairs, and gave
the key and the letter to Sam.</p>

<p>“Wise idea, Mary,” he said, when I told him that I had
locked the rooms, “I suppose Canneziano would tell you,
though, that locked doors do not a prison make.” He
handed the letter to him.</p>

<p>“Looks rather confusing, doesn’t it?” Canneziano
said, when he had unfolded and straightened the pages.
“Still, these things are generally quite simple. What
price deciphering it, Sam?”</p>

<p>“No price, to you,” Sam answered.</p>

<p>He returned the letter to its envelope and tossed it on
the table. “Fair enough,” he said.</p>

<p>“I fancy,” he questioned, next, “that Lynn MacDonald
is going to get rather a good thing out of this,
eh?”</p>

<p>“That depends on her success,” Sam answered.</p>

<p>“Yes? I understand that she takes jobs on that basis
quite often. It is not thoroughly approved in the best
criminal circles. Too much incentive to frame a case.
However, that theory of framing has been over exploited.
My proposition, cards on the table, is this: If I beat the
lady to it, discover the murderer before she does, will you
pay me what you have agreed to pay her?”</p>

<p>“Canneziano,” Sam said, “get this. Get it now. I’ll
pay you not one red cent for anything. Not one red cent.”</p>

<p>“Fair enough,” Canneziano repeated. “And my mistake.
Undoubtedly, I should have worded it differently.
For instance— What will you pay me not to discover
the murderer on the Desert Moon Ranch?”</p>

<p>A week ago, Sam would have got up and kicked him
out through the door for that question. This evening
Sam sat still and looked him over, sort of sliding his eyes
up and down over his smooth dapperness. Finally he
drawled, “Go as far as you like, Canneziano. Only—you
won’t get anywhere you’d like to be, not on that
line.”</p>

<p>“Presently, perhaps,” Canneziano answered. “No
hurry.”</p>

<p>I’ll be switched if Sam didn’t sit there and murmur,
mildly, “ ‘Said the carpenter,’ ” to himself.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch38">

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII. <br> Lynn MacDonald</h2>

<p>On Friday afternoon, late, I went with John and
Sam down to Rattail to meet the train. When it
came thundering, snorting up, I thought of the last time
that Sam and I had met a train together, and of how our
entire world had changed in the two months. Was it going
to keep on changing, I wondered. I could not bear to look
into the past; I found that I did not dare to try to think
into the future.</p>

<p>Just before the train stopped, with its usual roar of
protest against Rattail, Clarence Pette swung off it. He
came over to us with a timid air, like an animal just
learning to eat out of a person’s hand. He took no risks,
until Sam had greeted him, real pleasantly, and politely.</p>

<p>“Miss MacDonald is on this train,” he said to Sam
and me. “Is there anything else I can do for you?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing, if you are positive that she is Miss
MacDonald, except to take your fifty—here it is—and
vamoose.”</p>

<p>“I’m positive. Thanks. Here she comes now.”</p>

<p>I looked up to see her coming. I could hardly believe
my eyes. I don’t know what I had expected; but I surely
had not expected anything to get off that smoke-dirty
train, in the middle of a Nevada desert, on a sweltering
hot July evening, that looked as she did.</p>

<p>In the first place, in her pongee silk dress with coat to
match, and perky little green hat, she looked as if she
had been fresh picked, in the last nice California garden,
and had been kept under glass, on ice ever since. But that
was only a part of it. She looked, too, like linen sheets
feel, at the end of a long hard day; sheets that have been
hand-washed, and sun-dried, and dew-dampened, and
ironed smooth as satin. She looked like very early on a
September morning, in our mountains—that was the
zip and the zest of her, combined with her comforting
freshness and cleanness.</p>

<p>She was tall; taller than most women, and with weight
enough to look durable and useful, but not a mite fat.
She had eyes that were as gray as pussywillows, and that
did no monkey-tricks of changing to green or blue; she
had wavy carrot-colored hair, that was so full of life it
looked as if it were trying to break the bonds of its neat,
boyish bob and go floating off, on its own, to make maybe
a tiny sunset cloud. Her nose was small; her mouth was a
mite too large, showing freely in a smile her teeth, little
and polished white, like a puppy’s.</p>

<p>Coming straight from San Francisco, she used no
visible cosmetics; which is much the same as if I had
said, rising out of the Pacific Ocean, she was as dry as a
chip. But you could no more imagine Lynn MacDonald
stopping anything, much less herself, to peer at her
freckled nose in a vanity-case’s mirror, than you could
imagine a baseball player stopping between first and
second base to take his temperature with a clinical
thermometer.</p>

<p>All of this general satisfactoriness, coming through the
alkali dust and offering to shake hands with a person,
was, I might say, disarming. My impulses were all mixed.
I felt like putting my old, muddled head down on that
nice high chest of hers and having a right good cry. And
yet, I felt for the first time in days, like a broad grin. I
managed it, and forewent the other.</p>

<p>Her voice was low and pleasant, but there was something
brisk and crisp about it, and about all of her, that
seemed to say plenty and plenty of time for everything,
but not one precious minute to waste.</p>

<p>In the background, during this meeting, John and
Danny had been hugging and kissing, as if the rolling
train right behind them, filled with staring people, were a
peaceful, flowing river, and the people fishes that were
swimming past. At last, to my relief, they came over
to join us; Danny, looking paler and more snuffed out
than usual, by contrast, maybe, with Miss MacDonald;
John beaming with triumph at having her home again.</p>

<p>“But,” Danny said, after Sam had introduced her to
Miss MacDonald, and had explained why Miss MacDonald
had come, “you didn’t tell me that you were
coming here.”</p>

<p>“You girls get acquainted on the train?” Sam asked.</p>

<p>“We had breakfast together in the diner this
morning,” Miss MacDonald answered.</p>

<p>“Did you know who I was?” Danny questioned.</p>

<p>“It was my business to know that, wasn’t it?” Miss
MacDonald smiled.</p>

<p>“Only—why didn’t you tell me?” Danny persisted.</p>

<p>“I don’t wonder that you ask,” Miss MacDonald said.
“And I hope that you will forgive me for seeming
unfriendly, secretive. It is, simply, that I never want my
first history of the case to come from the nearest relatives.
Of course they feel too deeply to see clearly. Mistaken
impressions are so hard to eradicate, that I go to any
lengths to avoid them. If I had made myself known this
morning, Miss Canneziano, I should have had to seem
more rude and ungracious than I seemed by acting as I
did. Because, please,” she included all of us in her glance,
“I have to ask each of you not to talk to me about the
case. I should have to refuse to listen. When I need to
know anything about it—I shall need to know many
things—I’ll ask it, as a direct question. Until I ask for
more, from you, if you will all do that, simply answer my
questions, you will help me immeasurably.”</p>

<p>“That’s easy,” Sam said.</p>

<p>“I am afraid,” she answered, “that it won’t be easy.
And I have to make another request that won’t be easy
to fulfill, either. It is, that no one will question me. I am
sorry to have to ask that. I am afraid that it seems as if
I were trying to surround myself with a glamour of
mystery—pretending to false wisdoms and acumens——”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” Sam interrupted. “ ‘He travels the
fastest who travels alone.’ ”</p>

<p>“I have always questioned that,” she said. “At any
rate, I don’t intend to travel all alone.”</p>

<p>“You mean you are going to take a few days to size
us up, and then get some of us to help you?” Sam asked.</p>

<p>“Question number one,” she said, and laughed, too.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX. <br> A Trap</h2>

<p>We had got into the sedan, by that time, and were
riding along the Victory Highway. I declare to
goodness, a sound that was pretty much like a ripple of
giggles went tittering around. It did us good, every last
one of us. It was antiseptic, as laughs so often are. Just
as I was thinking how much more wholesome everything
felt, since I had shaken hands with Miss MacDonald,
Danny, who was riding in the front seat beside John,
spoiled it all by emitting a shriek; it was not a very loud
one, but it was thick with horror and repulsion.</p>

<p>John talked to her for a minute or two in a low voice,
and then explained, over his shoulder to us, that he had
told her about “that man” being on the ranch.</p>

<p>“Uncle Sam,” Danny pleaded, “do I have to see him?”</p>

<p>“Well, Danny,” Sam apologized, “I’m right down
sorry about it; but, you see, he is staying on the place.
We’ll keep him out of your way as much as we can.”</p>

<p>“Why can’t he stay, if he has to stay at all, down at the
outfit’s quarters?” Danny asked.</p>

<p>“We’ll see what Miss MacDonald says. I kind of
thought, maybe, she’d like to have him where she could
keep an eye on him. I kind of wanted, myself, to keep
an eye on him.”</p>

<p>Danny put her head on John’s shoulder and began to
cry; weak, choking little sobs that hurt like having to
watch a sick baby.</p>

<p>“Poor little thing,” Miss MacDonald said to me, her
voice lowered and rich with sympathy.</p>

<p>I thought she would ask me what the trouble was, and
who the man was that was causing it. Instead, still speaking
low, to me, she said, “So often I get completely at
odds with my profession. And then I hear some woman
crying like that, or something else as heartbreaking comes
to me, and I know that I am justified. Not because I shall
discover this criminal. That won’t help this little girl,
greatly; but because I am one of an army that is fighting
crime.”</p>

<p>I didn’t say it, but I felt like telling her that she seemed
like a whole army herself—an army with banners.</p>

<p>I leaned forward and tried to sooth Danny; told her
that we would all do what we could to keep him away
from her, and to make it easy for her.</p>

<p>“It can’t be made easy,” she answered. “You can’t
keep him away from me. I won’t see him, I tell you.
I’ve been so homesick—and now to come home to this.
I can’t see him. I won’t——”</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald, who the minute before, had seemed
all pity for Danny, began, suddenly, to talk right through
and over her sobs, to Sam; to talk in rather a loud voice
about stock raising, paying no more attention to Danny’s
troubles than she paid to the humming of the motor.</p>

<p>I sat and sulked and nursed my disappointment. If I
had been a man—which praise the Lord I am not—it
would have been a case of love at first sight with me
toward Lynn MacDonald. But now I told myself bitterly
that I had been a fool to expect real womanly sympathy
and kindness from a person in her profession. Ferreting
out criminals would make anyone as hard as nails. I
was right, in a way. That was not the last time I was to
see her turn, suddenly, from a sympathetic woman into
a crime analyst. It was sort of a pity, though, that I had
to see that side of her so soon; so long before I could begin
to understand it.</p>

<p>Not until Danny had quieted down, and had turned to
us with stammered apologies and attempted explanations,
did Miss MacDonald ask, “Who is this man?”</p>

<p>“Dreadful as it must seem to you,” Danny answered,
“he is my father. But he has brought sorrow, and fear
and trouble to my mother, and to my sister, and to me,
whenever he came near us. He is a wicked man.”</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be possible,” Miss MacDonald turned to
Sam, “to have someone go ahead of us to the house,
and ask him to keep to his own room, this evening?”</p>

<p>“Well——” Sam hesitated. “But Danny will have to
meet him, sooner or later.”</p>

<p>“Better later, in this case, I should say. She will be
rested to-morrow. Possibly, too, it would be easier for her
if their first meeting could be in private. Shouldn’t you
rather see him alone, just at first, Miss Canneziano?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no!” Danny exclaimed. “I hope I need never see
him alone. Please—don’t any of you ever leave me alone
with him, not for a minute, if you can help it.”</p>

<p>For all the fuss she had made about it, I will say that
Danny did very well when we all went into the house
and she saw Canneziano, standing over by the east
windows, smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>“What-ho, Dan,” he said, smiling his smooth, smirking
smile at her. “You are looking seedy. Bad times
around here, lately.”</p>

<p>She didn’t go near him. She edged closer to John; but
she answered, looking at him straight and lifting her chin
in a pretty, dignified way she had, “Very, very bad times
indeed.” She and John walked through the room to the
stairway, and up the steps, and out of sight.</p>

<p>Canneziano stood watching them, a dark, ugly look
on his face. “There’s filial affection for you,” he said.
And then, with a half laugh, as he lit another cigarette,
and shook the flame from the match, “The girl is a
fool.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL. <br> The Missing Box</h2>

<p>Miss MacDonald came down to breakfast in
the morning, trim and white as a new candle. She
ate heartily, complimenting the food. She asked after
Danny, who had not come down for breakfast. She talked
about how splendidly the high altitude and the marvelous
Nevada air made her feel. She told us, who had lived
here all our lives and didn’t know it, that the air in
Nevada was supposed to be the best in the entire United
States for growing things. And, all the time, she was
either not noticing, or pretending not to notice, how we
were all hanging on her every word, and watching her
every movement.</p>

<p>I guessed the others were doing as I was doing; watching
for penetrating glances, and listening for catches in
her innocent questions. But, at that, I blushed for them;
particularly for John, who sat and stared at her as if she
were something he had to learn by heart, before the
meal was over. She caught him at it, several times; but,
though he would then have the grace to blush, and go
glancing about, he’d begin again, at the beginning, the
minute she looked away.</p>

<p>When we had finally finished breakfast, she asked Sam
if she might detain him. I stayed on, when the others had
left the dining-room. She said pointedly, though politely
and to Sam, not to me, that she wanted to speak to him
alone.</p>

<p>I took myself off. But the open window in the pass
pantry was too big a temptation; so I went in there,
softly, and stood far back and to the side.</p>

<p>Her very first words took me right off my feet. “Mr.
Stanley,” she questioned, “do you trust your
housekeeper?”</p>

<p>“Mary?” Sam drawled. “Well, now, I don’t know as
to trusting——”</p>

<p>I don’t know how to express what my feelings were
when I heard Sam say that. Pulverized is a word that
would edge it, I guess—as if I had been caught in a
sausage machine, and ground up into small pieces, each
one hurting on its own hook.</p>

<p>“But,” Sam continued, “if Mary was going on a long
journey, to indefinite foreign parts, and felt the need of
my right eye to take along with her, I’d loan it to her
for as long as she wanted it—no questions asked. I
can’t say that I’d go much further than that, though.”</p>

<p>I was whole again, and warm and glowing. Sam, the
old ninny, getting his dander up, and to a beautiful
woman like that, just because she had asked him a simple
question.</p>

<p>She laughed; a cheery, escaping sort of laugh, like
something with bright wings suddenly flying loose.</p>

<p>“Come back into the dining-room, then, Mrs. Magin,”
she called to me. “You can hear better in here.”</p>

<p>I came in, a mite shamefacedly. “It was my
overweening curiosity,” I explained.</p>

<p>Sam murmured, “ ‘Satiable.’ ”</p>

<p>“I like people with curiosity,” she said. “I understand
them, too; because, I suppose, I am one of the most
curious persons in the world. Another thing, I have never
found a truly curious person who was a wicked person.
As much as any generalization can be made, all criminals
are egotists. Curiosity means interest in the affairs of
others. Of course, one has to be able to discriminate
between innate curiosity and the slyness of self
protection—— But, forgive me, Mr. Stanley, I am
chattering away your time. Now then.”</p>

<p>(Later we became accustomed to that brisk professional
opening of hers, that “Now then,” as a signal
for getting right down to business, but it was as surprising,
heard for the first time, as biting your tongue.)</p>

<p>“Gabrielle Canneziano was last seen, alive, where and
at about what hour?”</p>

<p>We told her.</p>

<p>“Did she seem at ease, happy, untroubled?”</p>

<p>Sam said, “I was playing chess. I didn’t notice.”</p>

<p>“I did,” I said. “She was unhappy, troubled, and
frightened.”</p>

<p>“Frightened? Are you positive that you had that
impression at the time?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I spoke to Mrs. Ricker about it, right then.”</p>

<p>“Did she agree with you, then?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t say.”</p>

<p>“Did Gabrielle Canneziano speak to any one of you,
as she walked through the room?”</p>

<p>I told her about Gaby’s gesture to Chad, and about
him following her to the porch and talking to her there.</p>

<p>“Chadwick Caufield? The man who killed himself
when the body was found?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did he leave the porch with her?”</p>

<p>“No. He came straight back into the house.”</p>

<p>“What other members of the household were in the
room at that time?”</p>

<p>Sam told her.</p>

<p>“That leaves her sister, and your son and daughter
as the only members of the household who were absent
at the time. How long before Martha Stanley returned
to the house?”</p>

<p>Sam said, “I was playing chess. But I know it wasn’t
long.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t more than five or six minutes,” I said.</p>

<p>“How long before Danielle Canneziano came
downstairs?”</p>

<p>I told her about Danny’s calling after Gaby. “It
wasn’t much more than ten minutes after she called,
not fifteen minutes, I am sure, before Danny came
downstairs.”</p>

<p>“Since you are a cook,” she said, “you probably have
more than the average ability in estimating time.”</p>

<p>“Good cooks,” I told her, “don’t estimate. They know.
When I’m boiling three minute eggs, I use my watch,
and always have.”</p>

<p>“At least, then,” she said, “you know how difficult
it is to deal accurately with minutes. With every desire
and reason to be honest, five minutes, in the testimony
of a witness, may be anything from two minutes to seventeen;
ten minutes, anything from five minutes to twenty-three;
twenty minutes, anything from nine minutes to
forty-five; forty-five minutes, anything from twenty-odd
to an hour and a half. Now then.”</p>

<p>She went on with her questioning. We had finished
breakfast at eight thirty o’clock. At eleven thirty, I felt
that she knew everything that Sam and I knew about
the case, and, probably, a deal more.</p>

<p>She knew about the two girls searching for something.</p>

<p>She knew about Gaby’s getting the code letter; about
her peculiar actions afterwards. She knew about the
quarrel with Sam.</p>

<p>She knew about John having gone to Rattail for
medicine that Danny said she had not sent for.</p>

<p>She knew about him taking four hours, instead of two
to make the trip; about the reasons he had given for that;
about him going straight upstairs, the back way, and
staying there for half an hour. In answer to her questions,
it was Sam and not I who told her about John’s acting
so bothered and troubled when he came down for
supper.</p>

<p>She knew about all of our actions between five and six
o’clock. She knew that Sam was unwilling to swear that
Hubert had been in the barn during that entire time.
Sam insisted upon telling her about Danny’s suspicions
concerning himself: that he had left Chad, the ventriloquist,
in the barn to hood-wink Hubert, and had gone off
somewhere.</p>

<p>She knew about me asking Chad to close the attic;
about the locked door; the key in my pocket. She knew
that I had found the body, and had stopped to clean away
Sam’s pipe ashes.</p>

<p>She had seen the note that Chad had left. She had compared
it, through her magnifying glass, with other specimens
of his handwriting. She had stated, positively, that
the note had been written by the same hand that had
written the names and jokes under the pictures in his
kodak album. She had spent ten minutes, or more, looking
at these pictures. Then she had asked Sam to explain,
in detail, why he had entirely discounted Chad’s note
of confession.</p>

<p>Sam said, “The body was cold and stiff when we found
it. That is proof, isn’t it, that she had been dead more
than an hour?”</p>

<p>“If you are certain of that, it is positive proof that she
had been dead much longer than one hour.”</p>

<p>“I am certain. Well, until seven o’clock that boy had
not been out of my sight for one minute, after Gaby
walked through the room, alive, for us all to see her, at
four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Twice,” Miss MacDonald objected, “you have told
me that you could not answer a question because, at the
time, you were absorbed in your chess game. How, then,
can you be certain that Chadwick Caufield was not out
of the living-room for a short time, say fifteen minutes,
between four and five o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Because he was playing the piano all that time.”</p>

<p>“You are certain that you would have noticed it, had
he stopped playing?”</p>

<p>“Certain. He was spoiling my game, and driving me
half crazy with his noise. I kept hoping that he would
stop. Kept forcing myself not to ask him to stop.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t you ask him, if it was annoying you to
that extent, in your own home?”</p>

<p>“Well, it was Chad’s home, too. He had as much right,
I reckon, to play his music as I had to play my chess
game.”</p>

<p>I liked the look Miss MacDonald sidled at me when
Sam said that.</p>

<p>“You, too, are sure,” she questioned me, “that
Chadwick Caufield was at the piano during that entire
hour?”</p>

<p>“I know it.”</p>

<p>“What sort of music was he playing?”</p>

<p>“He was improvising. It was happy, cheerful sort of
crooning music—if you know what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Yes. He did not seem worried, depressed?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit. He seemed happier than usual, I thought.”</p>

<p>She went on with her questions. They brought us to
Martha’s death. She took what seemed like a long time
asking us questions about Martha’s health. Had she
ever complained of dizziness? Shortness of breath?
Indigestion? And all sorts of other seemingly
unimportant things.</p>

<p>“Where,” she finally came back to the powders
again, “was this sleeping medicine purchased?”</p>

<p>Sam told her in San Francisco, with a doctor’s
prescription.</p>

<p>“Have you still some of them left, in the original box?”</p>

<p>“A few, I think.”</p>

<p>“Good. Will you get it for me, Mr. Stanley?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get it,” I said, and my opinion of her as a
detective was lowered, then and there. If she had not found
out, by this time, that it was useless to send a man to
look for anything anywhere, but, most particularly, in a
bathroom medicine closet, she still had too much to
learn.</p>

<p>I had seen the powder box, left out of place on the
table, the morning of the fifth of July, when I had gone
into the hall bathroom. I had picked it up, out of habit,
and replaced it in the medicine closet. I thought that I
could put my hand right on it.</p>

<p>I could not. When I opened the mirror door, the box
was not to be seen. I searched and searched. I might have
spared myself the trouble. From that day to this, the
box, with the remaining powders in it, has never been
found.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLI. <br> Questions</h2>

<p>“I was afraid of that,” Miss MacDonald said, when I
returned with my information and nothing else to the
dining-room. “Now then: Would it be possible for you to
remember who last took one of these powders, and when,
with no ill effects?”</p>

<p>“Danny and Mary each took one the night of the
fourth, when Martha did,” Sam answered. “I’ve asked
them about it, and both of them say that they did not
feel queer at all, afterwards. They were both wide awake
in the morning.”</p>

<p>“My word!” said Miss MacDonald.</p>

<p>“I think,” I offered, “that something was all wrong
with Martha’s heart before she took the powder. She
acted sleepy, stupid, all afternoon.”</p>

<p>“From noon on, you mean?”</p>

<p>“No—at least, I didn’t notice until later in the
afternoon. Mrs. Ricker said that she had a hard time keeping
her awake between seven and eight o’clock.”</p>

<p>“I see. Mrs. Ricker did not take one of the sleeping
powders that night?”</p>

<p>“She didn’t need one,” Sam explained. “She is naturally
calm. She didn’t go all to pieces like the other girls
did.”</p>

<p>“And yet, I have gathered that she was far from calm
when her daughter died?”</p>

<p>“She went clear, raving crazy,” I said.</p>

<p>“Yes. Now then——”</p>

<p>“Hold on a minute,” Sam said. “I think that you
think, from the questions you have been asking, that
the sleeping powder, like I gave the other girls, would not
have caused Martha’s death. Now I want to know——”</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Mr. Stanley,” she interrupted, “but I
have explained that I can not answer questions.”</p>

<p>“Suppose I insist on a few common sense questions
being answered, right now?”</p>

<p>“You can’t do that. You can hamper me in my progress.
You can dismiss me from the case, right now. But you
aren’t going to do either, are you?”</p>

<p>“I won’t hamper you, if I can help it. I won’t dismiss
you, as you say, now, either. It wouldn’t be right,
without giving you a chance, after you came all the way up
here, and you know it. That’s why you should try to be
reasonable.”</p>

<p>“I am trying to be reasonable, Mr. Stanley.” Her
smile at Sam, just then, looked as if she might be trying
to be something a mite more charming than reasonable,
besides. “Now then——”</p>

<p>She was off again, leading us with her questions,
through Mrs. Ricker’s confession and her suspicions of
Martha.</p>

<p>“After Martha came into the house with the bracelet,”
she asked, “was she out of the room again within the
hour; or even within the second hour, between five and
six?”</p>

<p>“She was not out between four and five,” I said. “She
might have been any place, for all I know, between five
and six. I was in the kitchen.”</p>

<p>“Did you have any particular reason for watching her
between four and five o’clock?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Then, I am afraid that you can not be positive that
she did not leave the room.”</p>

<p>“I am positive,” I insisted. “There weren’t any
goings nor comings. We all stayed right in the room. It
was too hot to move around. I know that Martha did not
leave the room. She sat beside Chad on the piano bench,
for a while. She sat on the arm of Sam’s chair, watching
the chess game——”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” Sam said. “I remember that, now. She was
fooling with my hair. I kept smelling the blacking on her
shoes.”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t have,” I said. “Because, Sam, she was
wearing white shoes.”</p>

<p>“She used some preparation to clean her white shoes,
I suppose?” Miss MacDonald asked.</p>

<p>“Some stuff called ‘White-o-clean.’ We all use it.”</p>

<p>She asked for the bottle. When I brought it, she smelled
of it, and asked Sam to. “Is that the odor you noticed?”
she questioned.</p>

<p>“Nothing like it.”</p>

<p>“Now then.”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” Sam said. “I’ve got two things to tell you
that you are overlooking, and I know that they are both
mighty important.”</p>

<p>“What are they?”</p>

<p>“The first one is this. Gaby had lived here close to two
months. Martha had never harmed her. Does it stand
to reason that, on the very day Gaby was afraid she was
going to be killed, Martha would do it? There’s too much
coincidence in that, isn’t there?”</p>

<p>“I think so,” she answered, breaking her rule for once,
at least. “Though we can not ever discount coincidence.
In the first place, what appears to be coincidence usually
proves not to be coincidence at all, in the end. In the
second place, genuine coincidences are much more
frequent than is generally supposed, or admitted. But,
Mr. Stanley, unless the other thing you have to tell me
is a fact, and not an opinion, I am going to ask you not to
tell it to me, at least not until later.”</p>

<p>“It is straight fact.”</p>

<p>“Very well, then?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather show you,” Sam said. “Then you wouldn’t
have to take my word for it. Will you come out to the
rabbit hutch with me?”</p>

<p>“But,” she questioned, “can that be necessary?”</p>

<p>“You can judge for yourself. Martha was always trying
experiments with feeding her rabbits. I guess she
thought that they might like grain. Maybe they do. I
don’t know. Anyway, she, or someone, had tugged a half
sack of grain up there. A lot of it had spilled out under
the berry bushes. It is all fresh sprouted, and growing
fine. Is that important, or not?”</p>

<p>Her brows puckered. “I’m sorry—I don’t follow you.”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t a spot out there, except under those
bushes, where Martha could have hidden the body. A
body, even as small as Gaby’s, would have smashed down
and broken those fresh sprouts of grain.”</p>

<p>“But—the body was never there.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Ricker said that she thought it was. We just
told you.”</p>

<p>Her mouth popped open with surprise. “But, Mr.
Stanley, you couldn’t have considered Mrs. Ricker’s
opinion seriously? Is it possible that you don’t know that
Gabrielle Canneziano was murdered right there on the
stairs, where she fell, and where she was found?”</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch42">

<h2>CHAPTER XLII. <br> A Revelation</h2>

<p>“How in blazes could I know it?” Sam said. “What’s
more, I don’t believe it. I think that she was
murdered outside, and carried in, afterwards.”</p>

<p>“My word! Weren’t you present when the body was
moved?”</p>

<p>“No. I—well, I didn’t care about being.”</p>

<p>“The fingers of her right hand were clutching the stair
tread with the grasp of death. Nothing can disprove
that. Dead fingers can not be made to clutch.”</p>

<p>“How do you know that?” Sam demanded. “About
her fingers, I mean.”</p>

<p>“To prove to you,” she said, after an instant’s
hesitation, “that my refusal to answer questions is not
merely an attempt to appear wise and mysterious, I am
going to answer this question.</p>

<p>“When I saw the body in the crematory in San
Francisco——”</p>

<p>“What!”</p>

<p>“I always do that, when I can. Before I sent you my
telegram, I had gone to see the body.”</p>

<p>“Did—does Danny know that?”</p>

<p>“No. It might be better not to tell her. It is a necessary
part of my profession. The crematory people realize that;
but, since people are often very sensitive about it, they
prefer that the relatives should not know that they allow
it. As I was saying, I saw, then, that the fingers on the
right hand had been broken. The undertaker had done
that, you understand, in order that they might look
natural to fold.</p>

<p>“When I had received your telegram engaging me to
take the case, I telephoned to the coroner and the
undertaker in Telko. I asked them to come to the train and
talk with me for the twenty minutes that the train stops
in Telko. I took a drawing-room for the purpose; so that
we could talk undisturbed and unnoticed. That will be
the reason for the day’s drawing-room charge on my
expense account, Mr. Stanley. I don’t want you to think
that I was unduly extravagant.”</p>

<p>“Extravagant! Hell!” Sam exploded, forgetting
himself. “What do I care about a drawing-room? What I
want to know is, what those fellows told you, and why
they didn’t tell me.”</p>

<p>“They corroborated the opinion I had formed, from
the fingers, about the death clutch, among other things.
I don’t know why they didn’t tell you that. Probably,
because they assumed that you already knew it. What
information I got from them, they gave with extreme
reluctance, due, I think, to their long-standing friendship
with you, and their desire not to incriminate any member
of your household. I got nothing from them—or, to put
it more fairly, perhaps, they were able to tell me nothing
except the facts concerning the position of the body.
Those facts proved that she had been killed on the
stairs, by someone who had been coming downstairs
behind her. How did it happen that you did not know
this?”</p>

<p>“As soon as I realized what had occurred,” Sam
explained, “I cleared everybody right out and locked
the door. I knew that it was necessary for the coroner to
examine the body before it had been disturbed.”</p>

<p>“How very, very sensible,” Miss MacDonald said.
But I did not quite like the way she said it.</p>

<p>“If you mean,” I spoke up, “how unfeeling, I want to
say that, though she had been living here for two months,
she had not exactly endeared herself to any of us.”</p>

<p>“No? I had understood that Chadwick Caufield was
deeply in love with her; that Mr. Hand was more or less
enamoured. There can be no doubt that her sister loved
her devotedly. That leaves Mr. Stanley, his son and
daughter, Mrs. Ricker and yourself, as the people to
whom she had not endeared herself.”</p>

<p>Sam and I received that in silence. It was one of those
odd things that was true, but that did not sound so.</p>

<p>I looked at my watch and said that it was time for me
to be starting to get dinner. She asked if she might help
me. I thought that she was trying only to be polite, and I
was making my refusal just as polite, when she
interrupted me.</p>

<p>“Please, Mrs. Magin,” she urged. “You mentioned at
breakfast that you had only one inefficient girl to help
you, just now. I love housework, of all sorts. And I want
to get intimately acquainted with this house. The best
way to do that is to work in it, isn’t it? You know—you
can’t know a stove until you have cooked on it, nor a
room until you have cleaned it. Won’t you let me help
you, as a special favor to me?”</p>

<p>Sam winked at me. “She isn’t going to let you out of
her sight, Mary.”</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald tried to smile, but she made a failure
of it.</p>

<p>“But you don’t need to worry, Mary,” Sam went on,
“because one thing, now, is dead certain. If Gaby was
murdered there on the steps, it is impossible that any
member of this household could have done it. It was,
anyway. But now it is sure. That clears us all.”</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald flashed out, in one of her rarely
shown tempers. “What utter nonsense,” she said.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch43">

<h2>CHAPTER XLIII. <br> A Shadow</h2>

<p>When it came to helping in the kitchen, that girl
was more help in five minutes than Belle, Sadie
and Goldie, all three of them together, had been in half
a day. She didn’t ask questions. She didn’t say where is
this, and how do you do that? She pitched in as if she
had been working in that kitchen with me for the past
twenty years. How she knew where I kept the potatoes,
where the best paring knife lived, and the particular
kettle that was best for cooking the potatoes in, I don’t
know, and I never shall know. Most mystery stories,
especially of late, have an element of the supernatural
in them. I tell you, that girl’s knowledge of my ways, and
the manner in which she took hold in the kitchen, are as
supernatural as anything ever brought to my notice.
The first thing I knew, she was peeling the potatoes,
and peeling them thin and clean. She didn’t ask how
many would be enough. When she got them peeled and
washed, she put them on, in boiling water, with no
inquiry as to where I kept the salt. She did not talk as she
worked. I was glad of that; for, after three solid hours
of conversation, I needed, badly, a silent space. I wanted
to think. Those last words of hers, “utter nonsense,” in
answer to Sam’s statement, kept ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>I tried to think whether there was any way a person
could get upstairs without coming through the house.
We had no fire escapes. There were no trees close enough
to the house so that even Douglas Fairbanks could swing
to an upstairs window from one of them. There were no
vines growing on the house. Without about a twenty
foot ladder, which we didn’t have on the place, and which
would be hard to go conveying about, to say nothing of
disposing of it afterwards, there was not any possible
way for anyone to get to the second floor of our house,
except by means of the back or the front stairway.</p>

<p>Since Gaby had been killed on the attic stairway, and
since all who knew about that sort of thing agreed that
she had been dead at least two hours when we found her,
she must have returned to the house sometime between
four and five o’clock, and have stolen upstairs with none
of us seeing or hearing her. Since she could do that, there
was no reason to suppose that someone else could not
have done the same thing; either coming in with her at
the time, or coming before or after she did. I had to
conclude that another person certainly had done just that;
had entered the house and had gone upstairs during that
hour. Who? The person whom she had been fearing?
Not one of us, that seemed a certainty. And yet, Miss
MacDonald had said, “nonsense.”</p>

<p>I remembered, again, her strange, mad actions
immediately after she had received the code letter. I
remembered how she had looked in the hall that day, when
I had told John that I thought I had seen the ghost of Sin.
In Gaby’s note to Danny she had written that she had
purposely kept her fears and her danger a secret from
Danny. Undoubtedly, the secret was written in the code
letter. Had she told Danny partly the truth about the
contents of that letter, or had she told her falsehoods
from beginning to end? Or had Danny told us only a part
of the truth? Why did we all keep forgetting how Danny
had tried to call Gaby back, when Gaby had started on
that fatal walk?</p>

<p>I have said before, and I say again, I knew that
Danielle Canneziano had not murdered her sister. But I
knew, too, that if she had some reason, some better
reason than I could conceive, for keeping quiet, for not
telling everything she knew, Danny was capable of so
doing. I remembered our talk in her room on the morning
of the fifth of July. I remembered how she had acted
when her engagement ring had slipped from her finger—and
I tried to turn my thoughts into different channels.</p>

<p>There was Chad’s suicide and his confession. It could
be possible that he had killed himself because he had
loved Gaby. But that would not account for his
confession to the crime. It could mean but one thing—a
desire to shield someone. Would he have cared about
shielding some unknown scoundrel who had crept into the
house and killed the girl whom Chad loved? Had Chad,
then, mistakenly suspected Martha, or Sam, or John,
and killed himself and left the note to aid one of them?
Not likely. Men do not kill themselves, leaving a written
confession to a crime of which they are innocent, because
of some mere suspicion.</p>

<p>I remembered my conversation with Hubert Hand in
the hall that morning. What was it that he had thought
I had overheard in the cabin and had bribed me not to
tell? It was reasonable enough to suppose that, at that
time, he had hoped to keep his entire story, his prison
records, his reason for coming to the Desert Moon, his
relations with Mrs. Ricker and Martha, a secret; just as
I had hoped to keep the fact of finding Sam’s pipe ashes
a secret.</p>

<p>Sam’s pipe ashes, again. If someone had put them
there, in an effort to implicate Sam, it would have had to
be someone who knew Sam’s ways. My thoughts were
off again. You can’t, I told myself, get shed of a following
shadow by running away from it. You have to turn and
face it, before you can go the other way. I faced it.</p>

<p>John. He had left the ranch at two o’clock. He could
easily have gotten back by four, or shortly after.
Suppose that he had left the machine down the road, quite
far down the road in the spot where the tire tracks showed
that the machine had been stopped and started again,
the spot where we thought he had changed a tire? He
could have climbed the fence, taken a short cut to the
house, and gotten here in half or three quarters of an
hour. He could have met Gaby; could have stolen into
the house with her. He could have killed her, and stolen
out of the house again. A short cut across the fields, and
a drive to the house would get him here by six o’clock—the
time he did get here. If he could be wicked enough to
murder, he could be wicked enough to arrange clues to
throw suspicions on his father and his sister. If he were
low enough to do that, he would be low enough to rob
her of a little money. In other words, grant that John is
a blonde, and you can go along and grant that he has
blue eyes and tow hair. It was all of it false, I told
myself, from its wicked beginning to its wicked end; false
and unfair. But I had faced it. Now I could turn and go
in another direction.</p>

<p>I had not realized how deeply I had been thinking,
dawdling over my work in consequence, until I saw that
Miss MacDonald had taken up the pork chops, and had
them in the warming-oven, and was making gravy, as
smooth and tasty looking pan-gravy as I ever saw.</p>

<p>“Good lands!” I said. “I’ve certainly come to one
conclusion.”</p>

<p>“It is a little early for conclusions, isn’t it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It is a lot too late for this one.”</p>

<p>“Please——” she began; but, for once, I got the best
of her.</p>

<p>“My conclusion is,” I said, “that, by hook or crook,
Sam Stanley has got to get me some efficient help in this
house. When I think of what I’ve put up with, all these
years in the way of help, and then see the way you pitch
in, it makes me mad all over.”</p>

<p>“I wish,” she said, “that I might drop this case, right
now, and stay here for all time, and be your assistant
and a thoroughly domestic person, and forget that there
were crimes and criminals in the world.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” I said, eagerly, but knowing of course that
it was too good to come true, “when you’ve finished with
this case, you could do that. You’d be one of our family,
and Sam would pay—well, I guess anything you’d care
to ask.”</p>

<p>“No,” she smiled, “it is tempting—now. But that
desire of mine to give up my profession is a phase that I
always pass through at the beginning of each difficult
case. In a few days, when I begin to get hold of something,
and when things begin to take shape, all my love of the
work will return. It is only at first, when I seem to be
in a maze of mystery, like this, that I get so discouraged.
I always do it, right at first; and I always think that here
is the case of which I am going to make an absolute
failure.”</p>

<p>“Have you ever failed on a case?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Indeed I have, on several. It is queer, though; in
each case that has been a failure, it has seemed that the
solution was written plainly from the start. It
was—written all wrong. Judging from that, I should be
unusually successful in this case.”</p>

<p>Poor girl, no wonder that she was discouraged. She has
given me leave, now that it is all over, to use any of her
notes that I care to use in the writing of this story.</p>

<p>“Far be it from Lynn MacDonald,” she said, when I
asked her about using the notes, “to refuse advertisement
of one of her banner cases. My rivals will say that
I succeeded in this because, as often happens, my luck
stood by me. But you and I, we understand about luck,
don’t we, Mary?”</p>

<p>“If you aren’t afraid,” I said, “that your notes may
give away some of the secrets of that luck of yours, so
that your rivals will be able to lay their hands on some of
the same brand?”</p>

<p>She laughed. “I never write down a secret. That is a
safe enough rule for an honest person, who plans to
remain honest. For a dishonest person, or for one who
contemplates any sort of evil, or admits the possibility of
such a course, the safe rule would be: ‘Never, under
any circumstances, put pen or pencil to paper.’ ”</p>

<p>As Sam would say, “It is a poor rule that won’t work
both ways.”</p>

<p>The notes that Miss MacDonald had made, before
this conversation of ours, that day in the kitchen, and on
the evening of that same day, July eleventh, are as
follows.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIV. <br> The Notes</h2>

<p>July 7. Saw body in crematory late to-night. Cause of
death, strangulation. Probably work of expert. Look
for Japanese on ranch. Broken fingers on right hand.
Beautiful, costly gown, lingerie, etc., indicating wealth
and good taste.</p>

<p>July 8. Rose, who has shadowed twin sister reports
nothing verging on suspicion. She attended services at
crematory. Evidence of genuine grief. Returned to hotel.
One telegram sent to Desert Moon Ranch. Received no
company. Mailed no letters. Did no shopping.</p>

<p>I received telegram from Desert Moon Ranch engaging
me on case. Explicit directions concerning train
probably due to inconvenience of meeting trains in rural
community, and not due to a desire to have me on the
same train with Miss C. However, note.</p>

<p>Telephoned to coroner and undertaker, requesting
them to give me conference in Telko. Also, had coroner
verify list of names, as published in “Examiner” of all
persons present on ranch at time of murder.
Note—absence of all ranch employees at the time.
Note—extreme reluctance of both coroner and undertaker to
give information, or to meet me in Telko.</p>

<p>July 9. Spent day in shadowing Miss C. myself. R’s
observations, as usual, excellent.</p>

<p>Rose’s research through back files of Nevada papers
provided following information.</p>

<p>Samuel Stanley, ranch owner. Very wealthy. Exemplary
character. High standing throughout state of
Nevada. Philanthropic.</p>

<p>John Stanley, adopted son of S. Stanley. Distinguished
himself on University of Nevada football team, 1916,
1917. Enlisted in air service for war, 1917. Mather’s
Field when armistice was declared.</p>

<p>Hubert Hand. Winner of chess tournament held in
Reno, 1914, 1915.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ollie Ricker. No report.</p>

<p>Chadwick Caufield. No report, except mention as
guest at Desert Moon Ranch.</p>

<p>Mary Magin. No report.</p>

<p>Danielle Canneziano. No report, except mention of her
arrival with sister, Gabrielle, at ranch last May.</p>

<p>Inspection of Miss C.’s room in hotel after she had
turned in her key revealed no clue. Unusually neat and
orderly person. Wastebaskets empty. Newspapers folded
on table. Magazine, “Ladies Home Journal” on table.
No heavy perfume. Hotel soap unwrapped. Fastidious.
Silver dollar left on table for chambermaid.</p>

<p>Rose reports: Miss C. went from hotel to Ferry Building
in taxicab. Crossed alone on ferry. Spoke to no one.
Boarded train at eight thirty o’clock and went at once to
her berth.</p>

<p>July 10. Afternoon. Breakfasted with Miss C. this morning.
No conversation. All the evidences of good breeding.</p>

<p>Had conference with coroner and undertaker. Think
that they strongly suspect John Stanley because of their
repeated efforts to keep me from sharing the suspicion.</p>

<p>Information gained from them: Girl murdered on
attic stairway. Position of body and marks on throat
prove an attack from the rear. Members of household
declare that rigor was complete when body was discovered
at eight o’clock the night of the fourth of July.
Amateur testimony, however. If fact, death must have
occurred at least three hours before discovery of body.</p>

<p>July 10. Night.</p>

<p>Allowed sudden “hunch” to betray reason and common
sense. Usual silly mistake at beginning of case. Set a
trap to catch hawk. Got caught myself. Luckily, no harm
done.</p>

<p>Met members of household. First impressions, before
hearing history of case other than gained from
newspapers, coroner and undertaker.</p>

<p>Danielle Canneziano. Impressions previously noted
sustained. Charming, lovable character. Innocent.</p>

<p>Samuel Stanley. Honest. Likable. Kindly. There is a
slight chance that he might be involved, unwittingly. He
is not stupid; but, decidedly, he is not clever.</p>

<p>Mary Magin. Intelligent. Imaginative. Honest.
Innocent.</p>

<p>John Stanley. Too handsome, but unconceited.
Bashful. Likable. Judgment suspended.</p>

<p>Hubert Hand. Egotistic. Clever. Judgment suspended.</p>

<p>Ollie Ricker. Life has treated her badly. She has put on
armor against it. Stupid. Perhaps sly. Judgment
suspended.</p>

<p>Daniel Canneziano. Criminal type. Alibi proves him
not guilty of the murder, but he is probably involved.
Why did he come here?</p>

<p>July 11. Evening.</p>

<p>Heard case history to-day from Mr. S. and Mrs. M.</p>

<p>Tempted to destroy all first impressions as recorded.
Remember, however, the value of mistaken impressions
is usually important.</p>

<p>Multiplicity of clues most amazing in my entire experience.
Would seem to indicate that many of them are false
clues.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Now, as I read over these notes, my good opinion of
myself rises until it runs over the pan. I declare to
goodness, the list of clues made out by Lynn MacDonald,
Crime Analyst, is not much better than the list made out
by Mary Magin, Cook and Housekeeper. She has done
hers in better form, and she has included a few things
that I left out. But, most of the included things were
unknown to me at the time I made my list. Many of the
other included things did not amount to shucks. For
instance, we have no dogs on the ranch because the dogs in
northeastern Nevada have a habit of running out and
associating with rabid coyotes, contracting rabies, coming
home and biting whoever is conveniently to hand. For
instance—but never mind. As I said before, poor girl, no
wonder she was discouraged.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLV. <br> Another Key</h2>

<p>As indicated by her notes for July eleventh, on
that afternoon Miss MacDonald had cleaned the
attic, thoroughly, and had found nothing to pay her for
her trouble. Keeping me in the dark, as she had, I
supposed, when she said early the next morning that she
wanted to clean the living-room, that she had got at least
a hat full of clues from the attic.</p>

<p>Land knows, the way I had been neglecting things, the
living-room was badly in need of a good cleaning. I
wanted her to allow me to help her, but she would not. It
was luck that I happened to come in with the floor wax
just as she was looking at something that she had dug out
of the ashes in the fireplace.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“I believe,” she answered, “that it is the missing key
to the attic door.”</p>

<p>She got up, shook out her skirts, and went straight
upstairs. I trailed along. I stood by and watched her while
she fitted the blackened key into the lock. It turned both
ways, as smoothly as you please.</p>

<p>Without bothering to say anything to me, she went up
and down the hall, trying the key in the locks of the other
doors. It fitted none of them. She went downstairs again,
with me trailing after her, and tried the key in all the
locks downstairs. It fitted none of them, either.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” she asked, showing at last that she
was conscious of my presence, which I was beginning to
doubt, “when you last had a fire in that fireplace?”</p>

<p>I thought a minute, and then told her on the night of
the fourth of July, during the storm.</p>

<p>“Do you remember who kindled the fire?”</p>

<p>“It had been fixed there, ready for the match, for
weeks. Things have gone to rack and ruin here lately; but
I always used to see to it that the fire was set in the
fireplace, ready to light when needed.”</p>

<p>“Do you happen to know who applied the match to the
fire that night?”</p>

<p>“Sam did.”</p>

<p>“But surely, even though the rain had come up, a fire
on the fourth of July could not have been necessary?”</p>

<p>“We don’t have fires here when they are necessary,”
I told her. “We have them when they are possible without
absolute suffocation. Half a pint of rain is plenty of
excuse for Sam to light a fire at any time, even if he has to
open all the doors and the windows to cool off.”</p>

<p>What I was saying was the honest truth; but I had a
mean feeling that she didn’t believe me.</p>

<p>Right here, with apologies to Miss MacDonald and
others of her profession, I want to say that if they would
just remember that nine times out of ten a person who
pretends to be telling the truth is telling it, it would save
them a lot of mistakes, and a lot of worry. The man who
spends his time biting his money to see whether or not it
is genuine doesn’t, usually, have much of it to bite; to say
nothing of the wear and tear on his own teeth, which
would be considerable.</p>

<p>I was standing by the living-room windows, trying to
keep my temper down with some such consoling thoughts
as these, when I saw a car drive up and the coroner and
the undertaker getting out of it.</p>

<p>I told Miss MacDonald the news, and asked her what
in the world she supposed they were coming here for, at
this time in the morning.</p>

<p>“I needed to see them again,” she answered. “Mr.
Stanley telephoned to them last evening.”</p>

<p>“Well,” I said, “that means that I’ve got about half an
hour to disguise a family meal as a company dinner——”</p>

<p>“Don’t bother,” she interrupted. “They won’t be here
for luncheon—dinner. I need to see them only about ten
minutes.”</p>

<p>I didn’t bother—answering. If she didn’t know any
more about the ways of people in this country than that,
I didn’t see why I should take it on myself to teach her.</p>

<p>But she was right. She talked to them a few minutes;
and, though I insisted that they stay for dinner, off they
went. It was an insult to the Desert Moon Ranch.
Everyone on the place, but Miss MacDonald, knew it. Two
weeks before, if a couple of friends had left the ranch at
eleven-thirty in the morning, with no reasonable excuse
for so doing, Sam would have blown up and burst with
rage. That noon he was not even decently indignantly
interested.</p>

<p>He had plenty of interest, though, concerning the finding
of the attic key. He had had it all settled, and was
satisfied that, since it had been proven that Gaby had
been killed on the stairway, it had also been proven that
no member of the household could have been implicated.
Now this second key coming to light, the key that must
have been put over back of the wood before the fire was
lighted that night, and that must have been blackened in
that one fire, because there had been no fire in that
fireplace since, dragged, to quote Sam, not wishing to use
such words on my own hook, “Every damn one of us back
into the damn mess again.”</p>

<p>“Sam,” I said, and I guess my only excuse is that I was
still angry at having my honest word doubted, “do you
know what I think? I think that Miss MacDonald—though
land knows she is a nice girl, and a living wonder
as help in the kitchen and around the house—is going to
be a flat fizzle from start to finish when it comes to
discovering the murderer.”</p>

<p>“That’s kind of the way I got it sized up, too,” Sam
said. “But if she’s good help to you, she’s worth a lot
more than her expenses.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t the cost of her,” I said. “I’m afraid she is
going to do a lot of harm around here.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, Mary!” he said. “If anyone can do any
more harm around here than has been done
already—why, leave ’em do it.”</p>

<p>“Not much with your ‘leave ’em do its,’ ” I said. “My
idea is that we’ve had about enough trouble. What I’m
getting at is this, Sam: I think that fool girl, at present, is
suspecting you more than any other one of us.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I had that sized up, too,” he said.
“But let her go ahead. If she can prove I’m guilty, I’m
willing to hang for it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be a fool, Sam,” I snapped. “Did you ever
happen to hear of circumstantial evidence?”</p>

<p>“You bet. But they can’t hang more than one innocent
person on circumstantial evidence, and there’s enough of
that stuff around here now to hang about five or six of us.
I’ll take my chances with the rest of you, Mary.”</p>

<p>“Lands, Sam,” I was taken aback, “do you think she
suspects me?”</p>

<p>Something pretty close to the old twinkle came into
Sam’s eyes. “Well, Mary, Gaby was one extra to do for
and she came late to meals and pestered you quite a lot.
Furthermore, though it hasn’t been made a point of, you
were all alone in the kitchen for the hour between five and
six o’clock. You might have slipped up and have done the
deed between the time you put the meat on and took the
biscuits out.”</p>

<p>I knew that he thought he was being funny; but I
didn’t like it. “See here, Sam,” I began, “Danny was
going back and forth all the time——”</p>

<p>“ ‘Now then,’ ” Sam interrupted, mocking Miss
MacDonald. “Did Miss Canneziano have any particular
reason for watching you? No. I see. Then, I am afraid, she
can not be positive that you were not out of the kitchen.
Twenty minutes often seem like two hours and sixteen
minutes——</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what, Mary,” Sam got suddenly serious.
“I’m going to wait a few more days, and then if this lady
isn’t progressing a deal faster than she is at present, I’m
going to pay her off, full amount, of course, and wire to
’Frisco for a plain, ordinary, he-man detective to come up
here and take hold of things. By the way,” he went on,
“does it seem to you that Danny and Canneziano are
getting along all right?”</p>

<p>“I judge it isn’t a case of their getting along, much,” I
said. “So far as I know, she hasn’t spoken a word to him
since she greeted him the evening she came home.”</p>

<p>“Well,” he hesitated, “well—I know a mite further
than that. I’ll tell you, sometime that isn’t dinner
time—maybe.”</p>

<p>He went into the dining-room, and I followed him.</p>

<p>All during that dinner, and the same had been true of
every meal since the first breakfast I’ve mentioned, John
hardly took his eyes off of Miss MacDonald. I made a
way to speak to him about it, alone, right after
dinner.</p>

<p>“John,” I said, “for Mercy’s sakes, what do you want
to sit and stare at Miss MacDonald for, during meals, like
she was the place where you had lost something?”</p>

<p>He blushed. “Gosh, Mary! I haven’t been doing that,
have I?”</p>

<p>“You certainly have. It doesn’t look nice, John. Why
do you do it?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that I did. But, on the square, did you
ever see anything as pretty—I mean, as clean and—well,
kind of comforting looking? She changes so, too; like a
diamond, or a desert, or a sunrise, or—something. Did
you ever see anyone as interesting to look at, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Never mind asking me,” I said. “Just you go and ask
Danny some of those questions.”</p>

<p>“Danny,” he answered, “is—well, Danny is Danny, of
course. She’s different.”</p>

<p>“Better take to watching how different she is,” I
advised, and left him to think it over, and went into the
living-room.</p>

<p>Canneziano was loafing around in there. “Mary,”
he said, “I’ll make a dicker with you.”</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch46">

<h2>CHAPTER XLVI. <br> A Dicker</h2>

<p>“Not with me,” I said, and started up the stairs.</p>

<p>Curiosity like mine is a curse. I’d gone about four
steps up when it caught me. “What’s your old dicker?”
I said.</p>

<p>“If you’ll persuade Sam to give me the ten thousand
for producing the murderer, I’ll split it with you.”</p>

<p>I am tired of apologizing for myself. I will state, merely,
that I managed to say the one thing, under those
circumstances, that I should not have said. “Do you know who
the murderer is?” Thereby proving that I was possessed
of about as much diplomacy as an alarm clock.</p>

<p>“Certainly not,” he answered. He had not hesitated;
he had looked straight into my eyes. But I knew that he
believed that he had lied.</p>

<p>“See here,” I said. “I take it that one five thousand
dollars is as good to you as another. If you know who
committed the murder, and will produce him, I’ll give
you the five thousand dollars myself.”</p>

<p>“Don’t say that, Mary,” Danny stepped out from behind
the long curtains at the end of the south windows.</p>

<p>Canneziano jumped like a spurred bronco. “Spying,
eh, my lady?”</p>

<p>She spoke directly to me. “Listen, Mary; don’t ever,
for any reason, enter into any sort of an agreement with
this man. If he knows, or thinks that he knows, who the
murderer is, he can be forced to tell without a bribe. If he
had known for one day, one hour, and had withheld the
information, he is, in effect, an accomplice—there is a
legal term for it, but I have forgotten it. I am going out,
now, to find Uncle Sam, and to bring him here and tell
him that this man says that he knows who committed the
murder. Mary, you telephone to the sheriff in Telko——”</p>

<p>“Just a moment, please,” Canneziano spoke smoothly
and smilingly. “I have said, definitely, that I do not
know who killed the Gaby. And—I do not know. I am
bored, unspeakably bored. I should like to try my hand
at detecting this—er, villain. But,” he shrugged his
narrow shoulders, “with no impetus——”</p>

<p>“The fact that she was your own daughter——” I
began, hotly.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Mary,” Danny interrupted, with a sigh.
“There is no use. You and he do not speak the same
language.”</p>

<p>“How is this?” Canneziano said, and went on
speaking, very rapidly, in some foreign language.</p>

<p>Danny stood and stared at him without a mite of
expression on her face. He paused for breath. She said, “I
have forgotten my Italian. I do not understand you, and
I am glad that I do not. Come, Mary, shall we go
upstairs?”</p>

<p>In the upper hall she said that she wanted me to go
with her to Miss MacDonald, because she wanted to tell
Miss MacDonald what had just happened.</p>

<p>We knocked on her door. She greeted us pleasantly
enough, but there was a pucker between her eyebrows.</p>

<p>“You have asked us,” Danny began at once, “to tell
you nothing about the case. Does that mean that you
do not wish to have us tell you of day by day developments,
which seem to have a direct bearing on the case?”</p>

<p>“As, for instance?” Miss MacDonald questioned.</p>

<p>Danny told her about what had happened, from the
time she had stepped behind the curtains, until she and I
had come upstairs together.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald’s first question was, “Why were you
watching him?”</p>

<p>“Because,” Danny answered, straight, “I think he
came here with some evil purpose. I should like to find out
what that purpose is.”</p>

<p>“Why were you so eager to prevent Mrs. Magin’s
making a pact with him?”</p>

<p>“Miss MacDonald, a woman who has dealt with criminals,
as you must have, should not need to ask that
question.”</p>

<p>“But,” Miss MacDonald persisted, “you have not
dealt with criminals.”</p>

<p>“I have dealt with this man. I know that he is bad and
crafty. For five thousand dollars he would perjure himself
over and over again. He would produce witnesses who
would perjure themselves. You know the ways of criminals
better than I do, Miss MacDonald. I know, as Uncle
Sam knows, that it is unsafe to deal with them.”</p>

<p>“Has this man approached you with offers similar to
this one, Miss Canneziano?”</p>

<p>“He has had no opportunity.”</p>

<p>“You are sure of that?”</p>

<p>Danny’s chin went up a trifle. “I don’t understand.”</p>

<p>“I think that you do.”</p>

<p>Danny turned to me. “Mary,” she said, “yesterday
afternoon that man came to my room when I was alone.
He slipped in, closed my door, and locked it. I ran into
Gaby’s room, but I could not get out of it because the
doors were all locked. I went into Gaby’s bathroom and
locked myself in. I stayed there for half an hour, or longer,
until he left. Miss MacDonald evidently thinks that he
and I were in conversation during that time. I have no
proof that we weren’t. Do you believe me, Mary?”</p>

<p>“I do, with all my heart,” I said.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald persisted. “You told no one about
this?”</p>

<p>“I did not dare to tell. If John thought that that
man——” She stopped short.</p>

<p>“Yes?” questioned Miss MacDonald.</p>

<p>“I mean that John would fight with him; would whip
him within an inch of his life.”</p>

<p>“Why should you care?”</p>

<p>Danny looked at me.</p>

<p>“She’d care,” I said, answering the appeal in her big,
hurt eyes, “because she is a woman, Miss MacDonald. It
may be hard for you to understand; but women, who
aren’t crime analysts, don’t want their men fighting.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, Mary,” Danny said, and walked
hurriedly out of the room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLVII. <br> An Aid</h2>

<p>“Mrs. Magin,” Miss MacDonald began, right off,
the minute the door had closed behind Danny, “I
want to ask you to help me with this case.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t be any help to you,” I said. I guess I was
rather tart about it.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“One reason is,” I said, “that anybody who doesn’t
know any better than to suspicion Danny, in this affair,
would need a lot more help, to get anywhere, than I could
give them.”</p>

<p>“My only suspicion concerning Miss Canneziano,”
she answered, “is that she knows more than she is willing
to tell. I may be wrong about that. Have you any other
reason for refusing to help me?”</p>

<p>“Only that you don’t believe a word I say. If you
would consider that I am, anyway, trying to be honest,
and if you’d do the same with the others, until you are
sure that you have reason to do otherwise, I’d consider
it an honor to help you, and I’d thank you kindly.”</p>

<p>“I am afraid that I don’t entirely understand.”</p>

<p>“Crime and wickedness,” I told her, “aren’t the
general rules of the world. If they were, all the good
people would have to be locked up, for safety’s sake,
while the criminals ran loose for lack of space to confine
them. Why, instead of doubting my simple word, this
morning, when I told you how Sam always lighted a fire,
for any excuse, couldn’t you have believed that I was
telling the truth, and that whoever put the key in there
knew that Sam would light the fire, and so throw
suspicion on himself?”</p>

<p>“That is possible,” she admitted. “But the key, there,
leads me to suppose that whoever put it there, to hide it,
would be too stupid for much subtle reasoning. Keys,
you know, don’t burn.”</p>

<p>“They don’t,” I agreed. “But we never take the ashes
out of the fireplace as you did this morning. We open
the ash-dump and shoot them down into a barrel in the
basement. Every few months the ashes are emptied in
starvation field, eight miles or more away from here.
Not a bad way to get the key carried off the place, if that
was what he wanted. Not a bad way, either, to throw
more suspicion on Sam, if the key was found.”</p>

<p>“Most criminals are stupid, though,” she clung to
her point. “Try as they may, they always make some
stupid blunder.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me,” I said, “that the ones who get
caught are stupid; they are the ones who have made the
blunder, left the clue. But look at the number of criminals
who get clean away. Not long ago, I was reading some
statistics——”</p>

<p>“You know what Mark Twain said about statistics?
‘There are three kinds of liars: liars, damned liars, and
statistics.’ ”</p>

<p>I had to laugh. I think she said that to put me in a good
humor, for she went right on to say, “But you haven’t
told me, yet, that you will be my assistant in this case.”</p>

<p>She couldn’t hoodwink me. “I told you that I’d be
no use to you, as long as you doubted every word I said.”</p>

<p>“But,” she argued, “by your own admission you tried
to shield Mr. Stanley, immediately after the murder;
stopping to clean away his—the pipe ashes. If you tried,
once, to shield him, wouldn’t you try again to shield
him, if you needed to?”</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “I wouldn’t. I’ll tell you why. That
night, and for several days after, my mind was like a
dirty cluttered kitchen. I couldn’t get enough space
cleared in it to start thinking, let alone working at it. I
have tidied up a place, since then, and I’ve done a batch
of thinking. I know, now, that Sam doesn’t need me, nor
anyone, to shield him. Any evidence found against him,
will be good evidence, in the end, against whoever fixed it
to throw blame on him.”</p>

<p>“I am inclined to agree with you,” she said. “Now
then: Is there anyone here who would benefit by his
conviction?”</p>

<p>“Am I,” I questioned, “your assistant, or am I not?”</p>

<p>“Does it make a difference in your answer?” she
questioned in return.</p>

<p>“A deal of difference. Being your assistant honor
would bind me, wouldn’t it? If I know that you are
believing that I’ll help, and tell the truth, I’ll try to. If I
think I am to be doubted, anyway, maybe I’ll say what
I’d like to say.”</p>

<p>She sat and looked straight at me for at least half a
minute. “I do believe you,” she said, “and trust you. I
have, since I first met you at the station. I can’t help
myself. You’re all right, Mrs. Magin, and I know it.
I’ll agree to your terms. Now then: As my assistant, is
there anyone on the place who would benefit in any way
by Mr. Stanley’s conviction?”</p>

<p>“In a way,” I said, though it all but choked me, “John
would. He is to inherit everything Sam has. But John
loves Sam. And John didn’t do it.”</p>

<p>“Miss Canneziano would also benefit, then, wouldn’t
she, since she is to marry young Mr. Stanley?”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t make sense,” I said. “John has plenty of
his own, right now; and Sam would give them anything
and everything they wanted besides, as long as he lived.”</p>

<p>“I had understood,” she said, “that Mr. Stanley
objected to the marriage.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. He has asked them to wait a year.
That’s all.”</p>

<p>“Is there,” she asked, next, “any person at present
on the ranch whom you would concede might, possibly,
commit a murder?”</p>

<p>“Canneziano.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. And leaving him out of it?”</p>

<p>“Well,” I had to hesitate, “I am not sure. Every instinct
I have tells me that neither Hubert Hand nor Mrs.
Ricker—— No. It is an awful thing to say; but, do you
know, Gabrielle Canneziano herself was the only other
person who has ever been on this ranch whom I could
even imagine doing such a terrible thing.”</p>

<p>“I wonder why you disliked her so much?” she said.</p>

<p>“Because she didn’t have any of the decent, ordinary
virtues,” I answered. “She didn’t know anything about
them. Not charity, nor gratitude, nor kindness, nor
honesty, nor modesty, nor—nor anything.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t it strange that twin sisters, who looked as much
alike as these girls did, should be so entirely different as to
character?”</p>

<p>I had not seen her notes at that time. I did not know
that she had written “Innocent” after Danny’s name. I
spoke up, pretty hotly.</p>

<p>“Strange or not, it is true. In character those two girls
were as different as night and day. I never even thought
that they looked alike. Who told you that they did?”</p>

<p>“I have seen their photographs,” she reminded me.
“Chadwick Caufield’s album is filled with them.”</p>

<p>“Their photographs may look alike. They didn’t.”</p>

<p>“But they <em>did</em>,” she insisted.</p>

<p>“I tell you,” I said, “that they acted so differently,
and talked so differently, and dressed so differently, that
there was not one bit of likeness.”</p>

<p>“A most unusual state of affairs for duplicate twins.
These sunshine and tempest relationships are seldom
found, outside a Mary J. Holmes’ novel. Miss Danielle
Canneziano came here on a most doubtful errand; an
errand that amounted to robbery, nothing else——”</p>

<p>“If you are accusing Danny——” I interrupted.</p>

<p>“Oh, I am not!” There was a flash of temper in that.
“Making all allowances for mistakes in time, Miss
Canneziano could not have committed the murder herself.
But, suppose that her past was not as innocent and
blameless as she would like to have you all think. Suppose
that a revelation of all she knows, or suspects, concerning
her sister’s death, would also bring to light things that
she can not afford to have brought to light concerning
herself. It is at least reasonable to think that she knows
more than she is willing to tell.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” I had to admit. “But I doubt it.”</p>

<p>“Why do you so dislike that admission?”</p>

<p>“Because John loves her. John is a good boy. I’d hate
to see his heart broken.”</p>

<p>“Will you forgive me for saying that young Mr. Stanley
does not impress me as a man who is very deeply in
love?”</p>

<p>“I know,” I agreed. “Just now he is a mite put
out with Danny. He has been, ever since she accused
Sam.”</p>

<p>“Considering the circumstances under which Miss
Canneziano made that accusation, young Mr. Stanley is
acting most unjustly—if that is the case.”</p>

<p>“All men are unjust to the women they love,” I told
her. “It seems to be a part of it, like a rash with measles.”</p>

<p>She smiled at that, and changed the subject.</p>

<p>“I wonder whether you noticed,” she said, “that
coming up from the station I set a trap for Miss Canneziano.
Just for an instant, I fancied that there was more
fear than grief in her attitude toward meeting her father.
I suggested, you remember, that she see him alone? I
wanted to see whether she desired a private interview
with him. Her prompt refusal made it evident that she
had no secret to give to him, and expected to get none
from him. That is in her favor. Still——</p>

<p>“Before you go now, since you have agreed to help me,
do you mind if I direct a bit? I want you to keep one eye
on Miss Canneziano. I want you to keep the other eye on
Mr. Canneziano, Mr. Hand, and Mrs. Ricker. Will you
do that?”</p>

<p>“One whole eye for Danny,” I questioned, “and only
a third of an eye for each of the others?”</p>

<p>“For the present,” she smiled. “Will you do that?”</p>

<p>I said that I would. It was not until after dinner the
next day, when I was resting in my own room, feeling as
virtuous as the three monkeys, who see no evil, hear no evil,
speak no evil, pleased as Punch over my failures of the
past twenty-four hours, that I realized that I just
naturally could not carry through a job that went as much
against the grain as that job went.</p>

<p>We are, I thought, allowed to know some things—just
simple, honest knowing. And I knew that keeping a
suspicious eye on the girl who had said “bless your
heart” to me, on the evening of the second of July, was
as sensible as sitting up for Santa Claus.</p>

<p>Someone knocked on my door. I answered the knock.
Miss MacDonald, all smiles, was standing there.</p>

<p>“Let me come in,” she said; and, as soon as my door
was closed behind her, “A most fortunate thing has
happened.”</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch48">

<h2>CHAPTER XLVIII. <br> New Clues</h2>

<p>“Someone,” she went on, “has been to my desk and
has stolen the code letter.”</p>

<p>I could manage nothing but an echo. “Fortunate!” I
said.</p>

<p>“I had a careful copy of it, locked up, of course. I
have been leaving the letter in plain sight on my desk for
bait. Don’t you see, Mary,” she forgot her formality in
her excitement, “this is the mistake I have been hoping
for. I have found a beginning—at last. It is bound to be
easy from now on. Oh, Joy!”</p>

<p>She was almost doing dance steps. I wasn’t. I was
thinking, hard, in the tidy space in my mind; trying not
to get it cluttered with her excitement, trying to cook up
some common sense.</p>

<p>“The letter,” she went on, “could not have concerned
anyone in this house except Miss Canneziano, her father,
and, possibly, not probably, young Mr. Stanley.”</p>

<p>“I guess,” I said, “that was likely what you were
wanted to think.”</p>

<p>Her gray eyes questioned me.</p>

<p>“Supposing,” I answered, “that Mrs. Ricker, or
Hubert Hand, or anyone of us, wanted to get you clear
off the track, suspecting especially Danny, could one of
us do better than to steal the code letter?”</p>

<p>“My word!” she said. “And you, with a mind that
works like that, spending your life doing cooking.”</p>

<p>“Doing cooking,” I told her, “is how my mind comes
to work like that. If anyone ever told you that it didn’t
take brains to cook, he was making a big mistake.”</p>

<p>“But such quick, sure thinking,” she said, “is
marvelous.”</p>

<p>She laughed. “Listen to me doing a Dr. Watson for
your Holmes,” she said. “Golly, but I’m lucky to have
you at hand, though.”</p>

<p>I love to be flattered. I sat and preened myself.</p>

<p>“All the same,” she went on, “it does prove one thing.
That the murderer, or his close accomplice, is right here
on the place, now.”</p>

<p>“Chad’s confession proved that. The key in the
fireplace proved it, too.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no. Not conclusively. Now, let me see.” She
took a folded paper from the front of her dress. “Here is
my copy of the letter. It does look a mess, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>I looked at the paper and read, as before:</p>

<p>“Paexzazlytp! f-y nyx ogrgrsgo, rn fgao atf jan j-asn,
ahzgo zkg c-. ahhalo, vkgt nyx clplzgf rg lt zkg kypulzae,
zkaz nyx. . . .”</p>

<p>It surely looked a mess.</p>

<p>“The fact that it was written on the typewriter,” she
said, “makes me suspect that the typewriter may
unwrite it for us.”</p>

<p>I told her then what I had not thought to tell her before;
about my having heard the typewriter going, slowly,
in Gaby’s room right after she had received the letter.</p>

<p>“Fine!” she said. “She had burned the caps for the
keys, too—all but the curly ‘Q’ that rolled away. May I
use the same typewriter that she used?”</p>

<p>We went together into Gaby’s room.</p>

<p>“I should have thought you’d want to clean this room,
first of all,” I said.</p>

<p>“Mr. Stanley unlocked it for me that first night. I
spent five or six very busy hours in here, and I slept here
that night, too.”</p>

<p>“Upon my soul! Doesn’t that go to show? I’d have
taken oath in any court that you spent the night in your
own room.”</p>

<p>“That is exactly it,” she said. “Honest people are so
sure that they know things, which they don’t know at all,
and that they have seen things, which they haven’t seen.”</p>

<p>I have wished, since, that I had said something else
instead of saying, “Well, I might think I knew something
which I didn’t know; but I’d never make a mistake about
what I had seen or had not seen.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps not——” she said.</p>

<p>“Did you find anything in here that night?” I
questioned.</p>

<p>“Nothing. The burned papers were completely burned,
as they usually are. Of course, the complete absence of
clues should be made into a valuable clue—but I haven’t
quite worked it out. For instance, though, you insist
that she was a vain, conceited person?”</p>

<p>“If ever there was one.”</p>

<p>“Vain women usually have photographs of themselves
about. I found not one in here.”</p>

<p>“She used to have one, in a silver frame,” I said. I
looked around and saw the frame lying face down on the
mantel. I picked it up. An old faded picture of Sam and
Margarita in their wedding togs confronted me. I had
seen it plenty of times before, but in the old album
downstairs.</p>

<p>When I had shown it to Miss MacDonald, and had
told her about it, she took it and carried it to the window.</p>

<p>“The glass has been washed, carefully,” she said,
“since the picture was put in here.”</p>

<p>She pressed on the purple velvet back and took the
picture from the frame. Across the bottom of the picture,
where the wide silver frame had hidden it, written in
Gaby’s bold handwriting, were these words.</p>

<p>“My one deadly enemy.”</p>

<p>“My word!” said Miss MacDonald.</p>

<p>“Are you certain,” she questioned, next, “that the
girl’s mother is not living?”</p>

<p>“Don’t ask me to be certain of anything,” I said, and
looked for a chair to sit down in.</p>

<p>She came and put one of her capable hands on my
shoulders. “You shouldn’t let this trouble you,” she said.
“It is more than likely that Gabrielle Canneziano had
nothing to do with it. I must verify the handwriting.”</p>

<p>In the next instant she certainly gave me a fine turn.
Her eyes went big and round, her cheeks blazed with
blushes, and she clapped her hands to them and stood
staring at me as if I were the original human horror.
“I——” she gasped out, “I—have made a mistake.”</p>

<p>I felt like rising and giving her a good shaking.
“Lands!” I snapped. “Who hasn’t?”</p>

<p>“I would discharge one of my assistants like that,”
she snapped her fingers, “for such a mistake. Crime
analyst! Confounded ass! Conceited amateur! Oh!” She
went running out of the room, leaving me sitting there to
do what I liked with that talk of hers.</p>

<p>She was back in two minutes. She had Gaby’s last note
to Danny in her hands. “I have been assuming,” she
said, and her cheeks flamed up again, “that Gabrielle
Canneziano wrote this note. I have had a pleasant little
assumption. Now I will get some facts. I must find a
sample of her handwriting——”</p>

<p>She began to search through Gaby’s desk. I helped her.
Gaby had made a thorough job of her burning. There
was not a scratch of her writing to be found.</p>

<p>“Danny will have something,” I said. “I’ll see whether
she is in her room.”</p>

<p>Danny was in her room, sitting at her own desk, writing
out checks and addressing envelopes. I told her I
had come to ask her for a sample of Gaby’s handwriting.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, Mary,” she said, as she finished addressing
an envelope, sealed it, and looked for a stamp in the
stamp-box, “but I haven’t anything, except, of course,
the last note she wrote to me, and Miss MacDonald is
keeping that.”</p>

<p>“Please, dear,” I urged, “won’t you search through
your desk and your papers? It is really very important.”</p>

<p>“But I have looked, Mary. Mrs. Ricker had the same
idea, yesterday. She thought that Gaby might not have
written that last note. I am certain that she did; but I
searched and searched to satisfy Mrs. Ricker. I destroyed
Gaby’s letters to me, when we came to the United States.
She has had no reason for writing anything to me since
then. Hubert Hand had several notes from her; but he
says he has not kept them.”</p>

<p>She addressed another envelope, and added it to the
pile beside her. “It isn’t,” she said, noticing my reluctance
to leave, “that I am not interested, Mary. It is only
that I know that I haven’t a scrap of her writing.”</p>

<p>I turned to go. I had reached the door when she called
to me and asked me to take her letters downstairs for the
mailbag, when I went downstairs.</p>

<p>I returned to Miss MacDonald with my information.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” she said. “Mrs. Ricker indeed? If only
they would work with me, Mary, instead of by themselves,
or—against me. At any rate,” she put aside the
photograph, a ruler-like thing, and her magnifying glass,
“the note to Danielle Canneziano, and the writing on
the photograph were done by the same person. What are
the letters you have there, in your hand, Mrs. Magin?”</p>

<p>I told her they were some that Danny had asked me
to take downstairs. She held out her hand for them. I
had to allow her to have them. But first I read the
addresses. They were the names of mail-order stores in
Portland, Oregon, and in San Francisco, California.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald looked at them closely. Then she
took up a flat paper knife, from Gaby’s desk, and
deliberately opened the envelope by lifting the flap.</p>

<p>“She surely does not seal her letters carefully,” she
said, and took out a check, nothing else, from the
envelope.</p>

<p>“It is dated to-day, the thirteenth of July,” she said.</p>

<p>“Of course it is,” I answered, tartly, not liking any of
this. “She was writing them just now, while I was in
there.”</p>

<p>“Did you see her writing them?” she asked.</p>

<p>“I certainly did.”</p>

<p>She sighed and moved her head with an impatient
gesture, rather like John’s worried gestures. “Then that
is that,” she said, and returned the check to the envelope,
sealed the envelope, and gave it, with the others, back
to me.</p>

<p>“Now for the code letter,” she said, and sat down in
front of the typewriter. I left her there, and went to look
for Sam.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XLIX. <br> New Suspicions</h2>

<p>I found him in the living-room, playing solitaire.
Mrs. Ricker was in the chair by the window, tatting.</p>

<p>“Lands, Sam,” I said, sitting down across the table
from him, “when did you take to sitting around and
wasting good time like this?”</p>

<p>“I am helping Miss MacDonald,” he said. “Making it
easy for her to watch me and convincing her that I’m
more or less of a nut, at the same time. Two birds with
one stone——”</p>

<p>“She isn’t watching you,” Mrs. Ricker spoke up.
“She is watching Hubert and me.”</p>

<p>Queer that with all the years I had known Mrs. Ricker
as a dumb person, now that she had begun to talk, her
talking seemed only natural.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” Sam said, “that she is watching all of us
pretty closely.”</p>

<p>“No,” Mrs. Ricker insisted, “she is watching Hubert
and me. Chiefly me. I can’t stand it much longer. I am
losing my mind. If I don’t leave here, before long, I shall
be quite insane.”</p>

<p>I can’t say that Sam’s ears actually pricked up when
she said that, but they gave that impression.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know that you were thinking about leaving
here, Mrs. Ricker,” he said.</p>

<p>“I am thinking about it; because, if I don’t leave here,
soon, I shall have to be taken—to an insane asylum.”</p>

<p>“Now, now, Mrs. Ricker,” Sam urged, “don’t be feeling
like that. It is just a case of watch and let watch
around here, now——”</p>

<p>“It certainly is not a case of live and let live,” she said.
“I tell you, I can’t stand it!” She jumped up from her
chair, and went rushing out of the room through the
front door. On the porch she dropped into a chair, and
hid her face in her hands.</p>

<p>As I looked at her, sitting there, I remembered that it
was she who had found the body. Her story had sounded
straight enough; but, before she had told it, she had had
plenty of time to make it a straight one. Perhaps she had
had help in making it a straight one. . . .</p>

<p>Hubert Hand. He had, by his own admission, served
a term in prison for forgery. He had had notes from
Gaby, and had destroyed them. Was it possible that he
might have written the farewell note to Gaby, and the
inscription on the photograph? Sam could not swear that
Hubert Hand had been in the barn the entire hour between
five and six o’clock. That meant, then, that no one
knew, positively, where he had been between five and six
o’clock. I remembered how eager he had been, at first,
to prove that John was the guilty person; how readily
he had accepted the theory of Martha’s guilt. That
theory had been Mrs. Ricker’s. Mrs. Ricker loved Hubert
Hand. She had loved Martha, too; but Martha was dead.</p>

<p>Would it have been possible for Hubert Hand to have
slipped into the house, through the front door, during
that hour between five and six, without Danny’s having
seen him? Possible—that was all. Danny had cut the
bread, in the kitchen. She had emptied jelly from its glass
to a dish; had cut the butter. Each task a matter of
minutes; but coming through the front door and getting
upstairs would be a matter of minutes, also. Mrs. Ricker,
of course, would have seen Hubert Hand pass through
the room; but Mrs. Ricker could keep a secret.</p>

<p>Again, what had he thought that I had overheard that
day in the cabin?</p>

<p>What motive could he have had for killing Gaby?
Suppose that Gaby had lied to Danny about the entire
contents of the code letter, and that, after all, the money
had been hidden on the place. That would be an explanation
for Canneziano’s coming to the ranch. But suppose
that Hubert Hand had found it, or had known that Gaby
had found it——</p>

<p>“Come home, Mary,” Sam’s voice, speaking extra
low, cut in on my reverie. “I want to know what you
think about this.</p>

<p>“I set Canneziano to mending the south clover fence
this morning. I told him I was going to north clover. On
my way there, I passed the house. I happened to
remember how slick Miss MacDonald had cleaned the attic.
It seemed a shame not to use it; so I went up, taking my
field glasses with me, for luck. I’d watched about five
minutes, out of the window, when I saw Canneziano
leave the fence and make up toward the cabin. I came
down, jumped on Bobbie Burns, and circled around the
hill, back of the cabin. Just as I got my glasses trained,
I saw Danny, walking to beat time, coming away from
the cabin. I don’t know whether she had been in it or not.
I didn’t see her come out of it. I rode straight down.
Before I had quite reached the cabin, Canneziano came
out of it. He was carrying a fishing rod, and he went right
down to the stream with it. What I’m wondering is, had
he and Danny met at the cabin, and had a talk?”</p>

<p>“I know exactly what Mrs. Ricker means,” I said,
“about losing her mind on this place. It has come to the
pass that no one can do any simple thing without being
spied on and suspected. Danny always takes her walks
in the direction of the cabin. We all do. It is the prettiest,
coolest walk on the place.”</p>

<p>“Does she always walk so fast, trying to keep cool?”</p>

<p>“Probably not,” I said, “unless she has seen Canneziano,
and is walking fast, trying to get away from him.”</p>

<p>Sam rubbed the back of his head. “By Joe! I hadn’t
thought of that.”</p>

<p>“Think about it now, for a minute,” I advised. “When
you get through, try to think whether you know of any
place where we could get hold of a scrap or two of Gaby’s
handwriting. We have the last note she wrote to Danny,
but we want something more.”</p>

<p>“You’ve come to the right place, for once,” he said,
and took a long envelope out of his pocket.</p>

<p>“I guess I never happened to mention to you, did I,
that I fixed up a small checking account for the girls in
the Telko Bank? It was just a matter of my own
convenience—saved me the pesky trouble of buying money
orders at the postoffice. Their bank statements and
canceled checks came in a few days ago. I was going to look
them over, soon as I could get around to it. Here they are.
Do you want me to take them up to Miss MacDonald?”</p>

<p>“I’ll take them,” I offered, “and save you the trip.”
I longed to see how much of Sam’s money the girls had
spent in one month, and what they had spent it for.</p>

<p>I don’t know yet whether it was cunning, contrariness,
or courtesy that propelled Sam up those stairs, with the
envelope tight in his hand, and without having allowed
me as much as a peek at its contents.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch50">

<h2>CHAPTER L. <br> Shovels</h2>

<p>I went into the kitchen and put through a fairly good
batch of baking, considering that I’d got a late start
at it. I had intended only to stir up a sunshine cake for
supper; but when a thunder shower came, washing everything
cool and sweet, I opened the kitchen wide to it,
and made an angel cake out of the whites of the eggs, and
baked a big pan of ginger bread. Zinnia did the washing
up; so I was all through and frosting the cakes, when
Miss MacDonald telephoned down to the kitchen and
asked me to go for a walk with her.</p>

<p>Between times, I’d roasted three chickens and got a
salad in the icebox. I wouldn’t need to turn a hand to
supper for an hour; so I told her that I’d like nothing
better than a breath of the clean, sage-seasoned air, and
that I’d be ready in ten minutes. I gave Zinnia a few
directions, and went upstairs to change my shoes.</p>

<p>As I came down the front stairs, into the living-room,
I saw Mrs. Ricker coming up the steps to the porch.
She was toting a big old shovel; carrying it out in front
of her, and carefully, right side up, like it was a pancake
turner and she had a pancake on it. I stopped in my
tracks. There are some connections that the mind refuses:
President Coolidge with a six-gun, for instance, or Chief
Justice Taft with a saxophone, or Mrs. Ricker with a
heavy, dirty old shovel.</p>

<p>She stopped to turn sidewise and open the screen door
with her foot, and then she came straight along into the
living-room, poking the thing toward Miss MacDonald.</p>

<p>“I want you to look at this,” she said.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald, all crisp in white linen, backed away
a mite; but she looked, as directed.</p>

<p>I came hurrying to look too. I don’t know what I
expected to see—nothing less than a dead scorpion; but,
certainly, something more than I did see: an old iron
shovel with dirt on it.</p>

<p>“Well?” Miss MacDonald questioned.</p>

<p>“I was going to Martha’s grave when the shower came
up. I stopped in the cabin. This shovel, and another one,
were inside the door there. Look at that earth—it is fresh
earth. Now I tell you, two people have been digging
around this place; and they were at it not longer ago
than yesterday, more likely this morning.”</p>

<p>“My word!” said Miss MacDonald. It seemed to me
there was more annoyance in her voice than there was
interest or astonishment.</p>

<p>“Somebody,” I pronounced, “still believes that there
is money hidden around here.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker nodded her satisfaction.</p>

<p>“But surely,” Miss MacDonald said, “around a farm,
a ranch, that is, around a place of this sort there must
be a great deal of digging going on. Gardens—vegetables,
you know. That is—one thing and another.” She fumbled
it, like that.</p>

<p>“We don’t make garden here in July,” I told her.
“The vegetable gardens and greenhouses are about
three miles away from where Mrs. Ricker found the
shovels.”</p>

<p>“To be sure.” She puckered her brows. “But—Mr.
Stanley spoke of fishing. Don’t the men dig worms for
bait?”</p>

<p>“Anyone,” I told her, “who did bait fishing on the
Desert Moon, would be about as popular as an S.P.C.A.
convention at a round-up. Likely you’ll learn our ways,
in time. Bait fishing isn’t one of them.”</p>

<p>While I had been getting this off my mind, Danny had
come downstairs. I guess we must have looked funny,
the three of us, standing there and staring at the shovel,
which Mrs. Ricker was still holding as if it were a pancake
turner.</p>

<p>“But—what is it?” Danny inquired.</p>

<p>“It is a shovel,” said Mrs. Ricker.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But what about it?”</p>

<p>“It has fresh earth on it,” Mrs. Ricker explained. “It
means that someone is still hunting for something on
this ranch.”</p>

<p>“I—don’t understand,” Danny faltered.</p>

<p>“You do, if anyone does,” Mrs. Ricker said, trying to
make it sound off-handish; but it did not.</p>

<p>To my surprise, Miss MacDonald answered, “I think
that you are mistaken, Mrs. Ricker. Miss Canneziano
knows, I fancy, no more about the shovel than you do.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker’s face flushed. She carried the thing out
and threw it into the yard with a gesture of furious
anger. When Miss MacDonald and I passed her on the
porch, she turned her head away and did not look at us.</p>

<p>“If we hurry,” I said, “we’ll have time to walk to
the cabin and see the other shovel.”</p>

<p>“Bother the other shovel! We don’t want to hurry.
Can’t we get down to the stream, somewhere close here,
and find a place where we can be alone to talk?”</p>

<p>“Right down this path,” I answered, and started down
it. She followed me. For fifty yards or more neither of us
said a word. I was too put about to feel like talking.</p>

<p>Why should she have told me to “bother the shovel”?
Why had she acted so peculiarly about the shovels,
anyway; choosing to assume that they were unimportant?
If, as I supposed she was thinking, Mrs. Ricker had gone
to the trouble to fix up those two shovels, and to carry
one of them in, to hoodwink us, that was important. I
was sure in my own mind that Ollie Ricker had not done
that. If she had not, and if two people were digging
around the place, they were digging for something,
weren’t they? For what? For exactly what I had
said—for money. Worms!</p>

<p>I must have made a sound that was suggestive of my
disgusted annoyance, for Miss MacDonald stepped up
to walk beside me on the narrow path.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” she said, “that I have seemed so
exasperatingly stupid: but I know that those shovels are of
no importance.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how you could know that,” I said.</p>

<p>“I am sorry again: but I have promised not to tell you
how I know it.”</p>

<p>“Not to tell me!”</p>

<p>“I meant, of course, that I had promised not to tell
anyone. My promise was made to Mr. Stanley. Since this
has come up, I am sure that he will allow me to break it
and tell you later what it is that I can’t tell you now.”</p>

<p>“Sam!” I said. I was mad all over. I had thought that,
anyway, Sam was open and above board with me.</p>

<p>“You’ll understand all about it, later,” she said.
“Please don’t be vexed. I have some really good news.
First, the handwriting on the checks, the photograph, and
the note all tally accurately. That must mean, that
Gabrielle Canneziano wrote all of them. Next, I have
worked out the key to the code letter——”</p>

<p>“Lands alive!” I said, my astonishment and admiration
getting the best of my bad humor. “In this short
time? Talk about wonders——”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it. The code is so simple that I am
surprised that people, who have wits enough to use a code
at all, would use it.</p>

<p>“The keys on typewriters, with a standard keyboard,
are arranged, you know, for the touch system of writing:
a, s, d, f, g, so on. All that this code amounts to, is taking
the letters straight as they come along: a, b, c, d; and so
on. From the center line of letters, they skip to the
upper line, making the ‘q’ be a ‘j’ and from the upper
line down to the lower line, making the ‘z’ a ‘t.’ They
use only the letters on the keyboard, and the punctuation
marks as they would rightly be used. Generally they put
a hyphen after the letter to be capitalized, though
occasionally they use the capital letter. It is so childish that
I fancy it is only a friendship code, and that it is not used
for matters of any real importance.”</p>

<p>“Then this letter is of no importance?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Not to the writer. Of vast importance to us, I believe.
It explains why the original letter was stolen, among
other things. Here is one of the copies that I made of it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LI. <br> Danielle’s Secret</h2>

<p>We had come to the stream, and to the shade of the
aspen trees. I sat down on one of the rocks, above
the first fishing hole, and unfolded the papers she had
given to me, and read:</p>

<p>“Salutations! Do you remember, my dear and gay
Gaby, after the V. affair, when you visited me in the
hospital, that you said, with your imitated Mona Lisa
smile, ‘Sorry, old dear, I made a trifling mistake, did I
not?’ The incident has probably passed from your
memory. It has not passed from mine, because I did not
believe then, and I do not believe now, that you intended
to fire that shot at V. instead of at me. You proved your
innocence, however, like the expert you are; so, ‘let the
dead past—’ et cetera. Particularly since I did not die,
but have lived to make, also, a trifling mistake.</p>

<p>“I find that I was in error concerning the train robbery.
After due reflection, I have remembered that, reading of
the details in the Denver papers, your respected father
and I merely regretted that we had not had the
forethought, and the cleverness, to have pulled the affair
ourselves. Since this is the case, we could not have hidden
the money, as I seem to recall telling you that we did,
on the Desert Moon Ranch. It was a pretty dream of
ours—that was all.</p>

<p>“Shall I explain? Do you remember the sweet cocotte
with the colored sash at Cannes? Very young, very
exquisite, and almost very innocent? She watched us, from
her table, out of the violet corners of her long, long eyes.
When we left the place, you and I, my gloves were
missing and I returned for them. You were duped, my dear,
were you not?</p>

<p>“She is not as lovely, not as gay as you were at
eighteen. But you are no longer eighteen. And you have
grown exacting, and a bit vicious (recalling, again, the
V. affair), and a bit selfish, too. (I knew that you
collected the final five hundred pounds from Baron T.)</p>

<p>“These, and all things considered, I seem to myself to
have acted rather nobly, rather compassionately. I spared
you the heartache of witnessing your supplantation.
Ours was a tender leave taking, was it not? I paid the
expenses of a long and costly journey for you and the
gentle Danielle. (Gad, Gaby, I’d have paid twice as much
to be rid of you for half the time!) I sent you to fond
relatives. I provided you with an interesting and romantic
occupation—treasure hunting. I gave the righteous
Danielle the opportunity for which she was pining; the
opportunity to try her hand at turning you into ‘an
honest woman.’</p>

<p>“Tell her, by the way, that her lover, or as she
virtuously insisted, her husband is still with me, and that
he is behaving himself admirably. I suspect that my Lili
is a bit over fond of him; but I have warned her that one
who has had the chaste affections of the little nun would
be unlikely to succumb to her ardencies.</p>

<p>“Lili now inquires to whom am I writing. She is eighteen;
she has seen you; so I dare tell her, to you, in a far
country with an amusing name—Nevada.</p>

<p>“She mispronounces it, deliciously. She blows it, and
you, charmingly away from the tips of her tiny pink
fingers. She kisses my ears. She tells me that she owns
me. So, I suppose, I should not sign myself, as of old,
Yours, with an ever increasing devotion, Bimbi.”</p>

<p>“Good lands alive!” I said. My stomach hurt me, and
my head ached.</p>

<p>“I am sorry for young Mr. Stanley,” Miss MacDonald
said. “But, you see, I was right in thinking that Miss
Canneziano’s life might hold a secret.”</p>

<p>“No! No!” Danny stood there in front of us, holding
to an aspen tree for support.</p>

<p>“I wondered whether you were coming out from behind
the tree,” Miss MacDonald said.</p>

<p>“I saw you looking at me. You are cruel. You are very
cruel.”</p>

<p>For a minute all I could be was sorry for Danny. I got
up and went to her and put an arm around her.</p>

<p>She tucked her head down on my breast. She was so
small that I could look right over it, at Miss MacDonald,
sitting there, undisturbed and triumphant. She was in
the right, and was a good girl; so it was queer that the
sight of her made my heart go straight out to the wrong,
bad, little Danny, with her brown head underneath my
chin.</p>

<p>“Danny, honey,” I said, “are you planning a divorce,
after you’ve had your six months in Nevada? Was he
cruel to you? Unfaithful?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” she said. “Nothing like that, nothing at all.
I can explain every word of it. But will anyone believe
me?”</p>

<p>“You just try it,” I urged. “I’m all set for believing
you, right here and now. Come over here, and rest, and
tell us all about it.”</p>

<p>I led her across to the rock where I had been sitting,
and made a place for her beside me.</p>

</div>

<div class="chapter" id="ch52">

<h2>CHAPTER LII. <br> An Explanation</h2>

<p>She began, right straight forward and sensible: “I
knew that was in the letter, and I longed to destroy
it, on that account, but I was afraid. I knew that
its disappearance would throw all sorts of suspicions on
me. But this morning, when I saw the thing, right there
on her desk, the temptation was too great. I never
thought of her having made a copy of it. This afternoon,
when I heard her at the typewriter—I knew. I’ve been in
torment ever since. I have prayed and prayed that she
might fail to work out the code. When I came downstairs,
just now, I knew that she had not failed. I thought
she would tell you about it; so I followed. I thought,
perhaps, if I’d tell you both the truth, and plead with you
to believe me—— But now I am ashamed to offer it.</p>

<p>“You won’t believe me. John won’t believe me—— But,
it was only a doll: one of those funny, long-legged,
floppy things, with an adorable face. I saw him in Paris,
and loved him, and bought him for mine. I called him
Christopher Clover, and said that he was my
husband—because I had always said that I would never marry.
Lewis—he was so horrid about everything—used to tease
me about my lover, until I got so tired of it, and so
ashamed, that I put him away on a closet shelf.</p>

<p>“After we were all packed, and the trunks were locked,
that last day, I found him there on the shelf. Gaby
wanted me to carry him on my arm—that was done quite
a bit over there. She thought it was <i>chic</i>; but I thought
it looked silly. I was going to leave him in the apartment;
but Lewis asked me to let him have him. I did. That is
all. But—will you let me see the copy of the letter? Gaby
read it to me only once.”</p>

<p>I gave it to her.</p>

<p>“See,” she said, eagerly, “he calls me righteous. See
how he speaks of the doll and his—Lili. He wouldn’t have
spoken like that about a man, nor said that he was
behaving himself. See, too, he calls me a nun. If you’ll be
fair—it seems to me you can easily believe me.”</p>

<p>“Honey child,” I said, and spoke the truth. “I do
believe you. It is sensible and reasonable. I believe every
word you’ve told us.”</p>

<p>“And you?” she appealed to Miss MacDonald.</p>

<p>“Your explanation is reasonable. You have told the
truth about everything else in the letter. Certainly, I
shall give you the benefit of the doubt.”</p>

<p>“You won’t tell John?” Danny pleaded.</p>

<p>“Of course not. Nor anyone else, just now. Shall we go
back to the house?”</p>

<p>Danny and I sat still.</p>

<p>“I’ll run along, then,” she said, and went away without
us.</p>

<p>“Danny,” I began at once, “you take my advice.
You get to John as quickly as you can and tell him the
truth about this. He loves you. He’ll want to believe you.
Men always believe whatever they want to believe.
Don’t you worry another mite about it.”</p>

<p>“Have you noticed,” she questioned, slowly, “that
John has been different—very different, ever since——”</p>

<p>“We’ve all been different, dear,” I told her.</p>

<p>“Yes, I know. But—John has been more different.
Mary, tell me, am I silly? Have you noticed that John
seems to be very much interested in this Miss MacDonald?
He looks at her all the time. And he jumps about,
waiting on her, rather as Chad used to do with Gaby.
Of course, he feels that I have changed, too. And I have.
I can’t keep from showing how unhappy I am, and how
worried. I suppose I constantly disappoint him. And
yet. . . .”</p>

<p>“Danny,” I said, “it is just this. Men don’t wear well
in times of trouble. They can’t help it. It is the way they
are mixed. So we women put up with it. We have to, if
we put up with men at all. Everything is going to come
out all right. But I want you to tell John, yourself, about
your doll and not wait for someone else to do it.”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to,” she agreed. “But we are so rarely alone
together any more.”</p>

<p>On our way back to the house, Sam and John overtook
us. I got Sam to walk along fast with me, and left them
lagging behind us.</p>

<p>“I’m a mite worried,” Sam said, “about those two
young folks. I don’t quite make them out, here lately.
I suggested to John, a while ago, that considering Danny’s
trouble, and all, it might be just as well for them to have
an early wedding. Told him to talk it over with Danny,
and that any date they set would be all right with me.</p>

<p>“I was all braced against being carried off and drowned
in a torrent of gratitude. No, siree. That young whelp
evaded it. Said that he’d see; and that she’d say that
right after so much trouble might not be a suitable time
for a wedding. I’d give a pretty to know what he has on
his mind. I can’t think that the boy is just rotten fickle.
And yet—he has been shining up to Miss MacDonald,
here of late. Have you noticed it, Mary?”</p>

<p>“Noticed, nothing!” was the best that I could do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIII. <br> Another Murder</h2>

<p>Canneziano did not come down for breakfast the
following morning. I thought that a little strange,
for meals were the one thing he had been real polite to
ever since he had been on the Desert Moon.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over, Miss MacDonald spoke
to Sam and asked him, as she had asked him that first
morning, if she might detain him. “You, also, Mrs.
Magin,” she smiled at me.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” she said, as soon as we three were alone
together, “if Mr. Canneziano could have given us the
slip, last night?”</p>

<p>“Not likely, with ten of the boys all drawing wages for
watching the place, and him in particular, is it?” Sam
questioned.</p>

<p>“Not at all likely. Still. . . . Will you go and see whether
or not he is in his room, now, Mr. Stanley?”</p>

<p>Sam went. When he came back he had to drawl a lot
more than usual to keep his voice steady. “His door is
locked. He doesn’t answer when I pound on it.”</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald said, “I have an excellent pass key.
Let’s go up and try it.”</p>

<p>Curiosity dragged me along with her and Sam, though
every bone in my body protested.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald’s key unlocked the door. The three
of us went into the room.</p>

<p>The blinds were tightly drawn. The electric fan was
whirring and buzzing away in the gray gloom.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald crossed the room, quickly, and
snapped up the blinds. There was one long, hard, dusty
shaft of yellow sunlight. Sam walked through it to the
bed where Canneziano was lying, huddled up under the
covers. I looked the other way.</p>

<p>I heard the rattle of Sam’s pipe as it fell on the floor.
I heard the rustle of Miss MacDonald’s quick movement.
I heard a queer, throaty note that she uttered. Something
dragged my hot, aching eyes open. I looked toward the
bed. I saw Canneziano’s swollen, discolored face. I saw
the deep yellow throat, with great brutal bruises at its
base. The shaft of sunlight moved up and down, up and
down, carving through the swaying blackness like a long
sharp knife.</p>

<p>I felt Sam’s strong hands on my shoulders, pressing me
down into a chair. I heard myself saying, shrilly, over and
over, “What are we going to do? What are we going to
do?”</p>

<p>It was Miss MacDonald’s voice, cold and clear as
spring water that brought me to my senses. “We are
going to find the murderer on the Desert Moon Ranch.”</p>

<p>Sam said, “You’re damn right we are. And we are
going to have half a dozen he-men detectives on this
place by to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” Miss MacDonald answered. “Will you
telephone, at once, for the coroner, Mr. Stanley?”</p>

<p>“Hell!” Sam said.</p>

<p>I had my face covered; but there was a hollowness in
that oath of Sam’s that told me, plainer than any looking
at him could have told me, that he was frightened;
scared to the marrow of his bones.</p>

<p>It took Miss MacDonald, though, to understand the
reason for his fear.</p>

<p>“Yes, Mr. Stanley,” she said, “these men, when they
come this time, in spite of their friendship for you, are
not going to be as easily satisfied as they were last time.
They were able to blink at one murder. They can’t keep
on blinking. They dare not—even in Nevada.”</p>

<p>“Who wants them to blink?” Sam bluffed.</p>

<p>“You do. We all do, for the present.”</p>

<p>Sam did not answer that. He stood, and looked stupid.</p>

<p>“Won’t you listen to reason,” she urged, “before you
go downstairs to telegraph for other detectives? In talking
to you this way, I am putting all of my pride behind me,
and I am violating my own code of professional ethics;
so I want to say, first, that if you will allow me to remain
on this case, I’ll take not one cent in payment.
Wait—— Let me have my say out, and then you may have yours.
My motives are not entirely unselfish—motives seldom
are. For one thing, I have never been dismissed from a
case. It is a humiliation I would pay any price to avoid.
I have other reasons—but no matter. That is my side
of it.</p>

<p>“Your side of it is this. If, when the coroner and the
others arrive to-day, you confess that no progress has
been made, they will undoubtedly step in and take
matters into their own bungling hands. I think that they
would make an arrest. That would be fatal, now. For
I am positive that they would arrest an innocent person,
and that the guilty person would then have an excellent
opportunity for escape.</p>

<p>“I have a certain reputation, Mr. Stanley, and these
men—particularly the sheriff—respect it. If you will
keep me on this case, I will tell them that I am making
definite progress. That I believe I shall be able to turn
the criminal over to the state within a comparatively
short time——”</p>

<p>“Would that be the truth?” Sam demanded.</p>

<p>She hesitated. “If you mean, is that what I believe
now—my answer is yes. I may be wrong. I have, at least, a
very definite suspicion. I have no proofs.”</p>

<p>“You wouldn’t,” Sam questioned, “give these men
that assurance if you knew that I was going to get some
men detectives up here to work with you?”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t,” she said. “I can speak only for myself.
I do not, can not work with detectives not of my own
choosing. I would give any one you brought here my
notes—the definite results of my investigations so far.
I would have no right, now, to give him anything else.”</p>

<p>“In other words,” Sam said, “you don’t care a whoop
about having the murderer discovered unless you can do
the discovering yourself, and get the credit for it?”</p>

<p>“Sam Stanley!” I said.</p>

<p>Her cheeks flamed. “Please get your other detectives
here as soon as possible, if you wish them to consult with
me before I leave for San Francisco.”</p>

<p>John’s voice came calling down the hall. “Dad? Are
you up here?”</p>

<p>“Wait!” Miss MacDonald commanded. “Tell him to
wait a moment.”</p>

<p>Sam opened the door a crack. “I’ll be with you in a
minute, son.” He closed the door, and stood looking
questions at Miss MacDonald.</p>

<p>She walked quickly across the room, and stopped
close to Sam, facing him. “I’m sorry I lost my temper,
just now. I’m not going, unless you force me to go. Please
don’t. Please give me my chance. Do you realize what it
means to be tried for a murder, even if one is acquitted?
I am not asking this for myself. I wouldn’t stoop to beg
for anything for myself as I am begging for this, now.
I am sure you mean to be a fair man. Be fair to me, and
to all of the innocent people here on your ranch. I don’t
say that other detectives might not be able to discover
the murderer. I do say that I am certain they would do
irreparable harm before they succeeded. . . .”</p>

<p>“If you stayed,” Sam had the cheek to question, “and
worked along with them—that was my idea—couldn’t
you prevent their doing any harm?”</p>

<p>“I could try to. I will try to, if you insist. But I am
doubtful of my success. Consciously, or unconsciously
they work against me, because I am a woman. You don’t
know them as I do. You don’t know their methods, as I
do. If you feel that you must have others here, working
on the case, allow me to send, at my own expense, for my
own assistants; the girls whom I have trained——”</p>

<p>“We don’t need any more girls around here,” Sam said.
“It is pretty certain that we do need someone to protect
the lives of all of us on this place——”</p>

<p>“When you telephone for the coroner,” she said,
“won’t you telephone for a locksmith to come out with
him, and bring strong bolts for all the doors——”</p>

<p>“You admit, then, that we are all in danger?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort. You are all perfectly safe—at
present. I do believe that before long, my own life
may be in danger. I want no one to think that I suspect
that. I need the protection of the bolts. It must
seem that I think that everyone needs the
protection.”</p>

<p>“You believe,” Sam questioned, “that your own life
is in danger. And yet——”</p>

<p>“Please re-consider, Mr. Stanley. Please allow me to
have the case alone, at any rate for a little while longer.”</p>

<p>“Game!” Sam had muttered it to himself, but I had
heard it. I knew that she had won, for the present, at
any rate.</p>

<p>“You honestly think,” he questioned, “that you can
manage this single handed, and keep us all safe, and
produce this murderer—pretty shortly?”</p>

<p>“I do, Mr. Stanley.”</p>

<p>“And you honestly think that other detectives coming
here now might make a peck of trouble, arrest the wrong
person, and mess things up generally?”</p>

<p>“I have never been more certain of anything. I think
the fact that you dismissed me, now, and sent for others,
would be damning evidence against innocence, to the men
from Telko.</p>

<p>“Let me meet them, in my professional capacity, to-day,
Mr. Stanley. Let me meet them, not as a failure, but
as a person confident of success. I know that I can
manage them, and send them away satisfied. Mary, can’t
you say something? Won’t you help me to persuade Mr.
Stanley?”</p>

<p>“You don’t need any help,” I told her. “He’s
persuaded.”</p>

<p>“Is that true, Mr. Stanley? May I have the case alone,
for a little while longer?” She was all breathless with
eagerness.</p>

<p>“Drat it all, yes,” Sam said. “I’m damned if I know
what I ought to do. But you are dead game. I—— Well,
shake on it, Miss MacDonald. You’ll do the best you can
for us, I know that.”</p>

<p>The hand she held out to him was trembling, and her
voice as she thanked him trembled. But still I was amazed
when, right after Sam had gone out of the room, she said
to me, “Mary, I believe on my soul that I have just had
an experience that is too strong for me,” and hid her
face in the crook of her arm and began to cry.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LIV. <br> Delay</h2>

<p>I myself heard the sheriff say to Sam, late in the
afternoon of the day we had found Canneziano, strangled
in his bed, “I tell you what, Sam, this is a pretty
dirty business—all of it. If you had anyone but Lynn
MacDonald on the case, I reckon it would be up to us
boys to step in and take a hand. But she has sure given
us some pretty good dope—and we’re waiting. She’s got
the rep. There’s that Dolingfetter movie murder. She put
that through when all the police force and all the dicks in
the country had failed for a year. And the Van Muiter
case—and a dozen others. I know you’re square, Sam.
All us guys around here know it. But I’m damn glad
you’ve got Lynn MacDonald on the job to prove it to
the country.”</p>

<p>As I say, I heard that conversation with my own ears.
And yet, in the week that followed, I had times of
thinking that, anyway, Sam had likely made a mistake in
keeping Miss MacDonald on, alone.</p>

<p>I couldn’t begin to describe the horror of that week.
It is, I suppose, what books call a paradox to say that
the worst thing about the week was that nothing, just
nothing, happened. To all outward appearances the
Desert Moon Ranch was as peaceful as an empty grave:
hollow peace, false peace, and all of us conniving at the
falsity made it worse.</p>

<p>One day, for instance, when we were all at dinner,
Zinnia dropped the teakettle in the kitchen. We women
all screamed. Sam whipped his six-gun from his back
pocket. John rushed to the kitchen. He came back, wiping
the sweat from his forehead.</p>

<p>“Zinnia dropped the teakettle. It didn’t hurt her.”</p>

<p>We all looked foolish, and began to be very busy, passing
things, and pretending that our actions had all been
the ordinary, conservative actions of people who had
heard anything heavy dropped.</p>

<p>Sam locked up the house early every evening. Then,
trying to make it casual, one and another of us would
go sauntering around to make sure that he hadn’t
overlooked a door, or a window. People were constantly
jumping, and starting, and looking behind them at
nothing. None of us women ever went far from the house,
except Mrs. Ricker to visit Martha’s grave. For one thing,
Sam had increased the guard around the place, and I
never felt sure, when I ran down to the dairy, that one
of the cowpunchers wouldn’t think I was trying to escape
and take a shot at me. For another thing, though both
murders had been done in the house, there was a feeling
of safety about four walls that I couldn’t get in the open
air.</p>

<p>As I have said, Mrs. Ricker went every day to visit
Martha’s grave. She went alone. I would not have gone
with her, not for any price. I was afraid of her. I was
afraid of Hubert Hand. By Wednesday of that week I
was afraid of everyone in the house except Miss
MacDonald and Sam. Friday found me doubtful of Sam.</p>

<p>Losing my mind? Of course I was, or it was losing itself
in the black shadow of crime, by which the Desert Moon
had been eclipsed. A mind can’t go straight, in darkness,
any more than a body can. None of our minds went
straight, those days. I am sure that the mind of each one
of us on the place—always excepting Miss MacDonald’s—did
as mine did. It went groping in the dark; it bumped
into obstacles of doubt; it tripped over fear and fell into
senseless stupidities; it lost its way, and wandered into
wild suspicions. I tell you, there were times, during those
frightful days, when I found myself seriously considering
whether or not I had committed the two murders.</p>

<p>On Thursday evening, of that week, Mrs. Ricker said
to me, with no concern at all in her manner, “I wish I
knew just how that lethal chamber that they use for
executions in this state, felt. Whether it hurts to be
executed that way, and how long it takes to die in it, and all
about it.</p>

<p>“Because,” she went on, still unconcernedly, “if it
didn’t hurt too much, I’d much rather confess to the
murders, and get it over, than to keep on living like this.
I am going insane. I think that I can’t stand another week
like this one. Every hour, now, is worse than a quick,
painless death. Too, I’m afraid of what I might do, if
I go clear mad, with all these horrors in my mind.
Though, perhaps, I have already gone mad. Do I seem to
you to be insane, right now, Mary?”</p>

<p>I told her no. But it was a flat lie. At that moment I
was certain that everyone on the place was more or less
insane, especially Miss MacDonald. I think yet that I
was right about the others. I know, now, that I was
wrong about Miss MacDonald; but she had certainly
given me plenty of reasons for thinking either that she
had lost her senses entirely, or else that she had never
had any to lose.</p>

<p>Apparently, after Sam had agreed to keep her on the
case, she had at once given up all interest in it. She had
a short talk with me, and told me that she would no
longer need my help, and expressly instructed me to stop
watching Danny and the others.</p>

<p>“As far as it is humanly possible,” she said, “I want
you to go about the business of living as if nothing at all
unpleasant, even, had happened. I don’t want this to be
an appearance. I want it to be a fact.”</p>

<p>Then, as if she knew I couldn’t follow those fool
instructions, and as if she were bound to have them
followed at any cost, she began to follow them herself.
She got sort of childish about it.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening she produced a bunch of paper
and some pencils. When we had all thought that something
important was going to happen, she suggested that
we play that old, silly game of “Consequences.” And
when we one and all had other things to do, she was none
too pleasant about it. Said that she was tired of reading,
every evening, and that the radio made her nervous.
She fussed about, until Danny, feeling as she did, got
John and Hubert Hand to make up the four to play
Bridge.</p>

<p>All week I could see Sam watching her and growing
more and more impatient. On Thursday he said to me
that she was too busy flirting with John to have time for
anything else. That was not fair. She didn’t flirt with
John—she wasn’t the sort who would flirt with anyone.
But she surely did begin to notice him, and his attentions
to her. It was not that she treated him too well, in any
way. It was, only, that she did not treat him quite
according to our standards for the way unengaged girls should
treat engaged or married men. Not once did she encourage
him to neglect Danny; but, after John had neglected
her, Miss MacDonald seemed to be, usually, right on
the spot, ready, waiting and willing, to be pleasant and
friendly to him.</p>

<p>I tried to make excuses for John. Poor little Danny
wasn’t, I had to admit, much like the girl he had fallen
in love with. She had lost practically all of her prettiness,
and she looked, all the time, too white and wan and
generally dragged out to seem quite wholesome. Like
the rest of us, the strain of fear and suspicion was too
much for her; but she was frailer than any of us, so the
strain told harder on her.</p>

<p>She had explained to John about the reference to her
and to her doll in the code letter. He had taken it all
right, and had been, as she said to me, “sweet” about it,
and about never doubting her word at all. Still, I sort of
thought that a grain of suspicion might still be bothering
him. And I knew that he had not been quite able to forgive
her, not for telling of her suspicions concerning Sam,
but for suspecting Sam in the first place.</p>

<p>Yes, I could make some excuses for John. But the
process of trying not to blame him, personally, resulted in
my opinions of men in general being forced down several
degrees. As I may have suggested, that took them just
about to where the thermometer stops registering.</p>

<p>On Friday morning, when Sam came zigzagging into
my kitchen, ordered Zinnia out of it, his voice all thick
and husky, and fell down into a chair, I did not doubt
for a minute that he was dead drunk. I knew that he had
not touched a drop of liquor for forty years; but what
men could do, men might do, and worse.</p>

<p>“Mary,” he said, “we’ve got the report from the
’Frisco chemists.”</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch55">

<h2>CHAPTER LV. <br> The Third Murder</h2>

<p>Miss MacDonald had thought it necessary to
have Martha’s body exhumed and sent to San
Francisco. That is what the coroner and the undertaker
had been about on their second trip to the ranch. Sam
had not wanted any of us to know about it, particularly
he had not wanted Mrs. Ricker to know. That had suited
Miss MacDonald better, too; so they had had the men
do the work while we were all at dinner that day. They
had been careful to fix the grave so that it would not
show that it had been disturbed; and then, being men,
they had left their shovels right there in the cabin for the
first person to find. As you know, the first person had
been Mrs. Ricker.</p>

<p>We had been waiting ever since for the chemist’s
report. Sam’s looks and actions, now, kept the question
from my lips. I thought that the report must have
contained some new horror. In a way, it had; but Sam’s
first words were reassuring.</p>

<p>“It is too good to be true,” he said, and repeated,
dazedly, “too good to be true. Miss MacDonald had her
assistants trace the prescription from Doctor Roe. The
powders were harmless. I didn’t cause my girl’s death.
The report proves—Miss MacDonald says—— The
report proves——”</p>

<p>“Take it easy, Sam. What does the report prove?”</p>

<p>“Somebody gave her a deadly poison. The chemists
found two traces. One they can’t analyze. That’s why
they’ve kept us waiting so long for the report. They are
still working on it, hoping for results. The other was
nitrobenzene. Miss MacDonald says that, in small doses, induces
coma and takes as long as twenty-four hours to act.
But it is apt not to be deadly by itself. It was combined
with this other drug—the one that must have made
death certain.”</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald came hurrying into the kitchen.
She was holding the monkey charm bracelet in her hand.</p>

<p>“See here,” she said, “this bangle thing opens. I
think we can be certain that the poison she took, or was
given, came out of it. There is a trace of the odor. Smell
it.”</p>

<p>She handed it to me. It smelled a little like shoe polish,
with sort of a faint almond flavoring, underneath. I gave
it to Sam, who had been reaching out his hand for it.
He smelled it, and then knotted it up in his fist.</p>

<p>Remembering, I can’t think of anything that he said
which would do to quote. The gist of it was, that if Gaby
had given Martha the poison, he was not sorry that Gaby
had been killed, because justice had been done. He went
on to say that, if she had not given it to Martha purposely,
but only carelessly, forgetting its deadliness, he
reckoned that things had turned out for the best, as far
as Gaby was concerned, anyway. Not satisfied with that,
he expressed, violently, his regrets that vengeance had
been taken out of his hands.</p>

<p>“It isn’t vengeance you want, Mr. Stanley,” Miss
MacDonald reminded him, pretty sternly, “but justice.
That is within our reach. I am practically certain that the
person who poisoned Martha, who strangled Miss Canneziano
and her father, is right here on this place——”</p>

<p>“Hold on,” Sam interrupted. “Considering that this
person is a poisoner and a strangler, and that he is around
loose and careless, and that we may all be murdered in
our beds, or out of ’em, or poisoned at our meals, it seems
to me the next move is to telephone to the sheriff, and
have him out here in a hurry, with some men——”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” Miss MacDonald snapped at
him. “I have told you before, and I tell you again, that
as matters stand now I am the only person on the ranch
who is in the least danger. I did not say that I was certain.
I said that I was practically certain. I can’t be certain
until I have some proof, some evidence. At present,
I have not one scrap of either——”</p>

<p>“Then you can’t know who the guilty person is.”</p>

<p>“Exactly what I have just said. My work from now on
is to get that proof. If you would help me, instead of——”</p>

<p>Sam interrupted, his whole body straining forward
with his eagerness. “Tell us who he is, and where he is,
and we’ll help you, right enough.”</p>

<p>“I can’t tell you. Not unless you want to have still
another murder on the Desert Moon Ranch. But you can
help me. First, by keeping the discovery of the poison a
secret. Second, by allowing everyone else on the place to
suppose that I am still in a state of entire bafflement
concerning the crime. Third, and most important, perhaps,
by having patience with me.”</p>

<p>“Ye’a,” Sam said, “and while we are sitting around,
having patience, this bird will walk off to some green hill
far away. I think the boys are doing their best to guard
the place, but this bird’s a slicker. What’s to keep him
from, say, dressing in my clothes some night, and riding
merrily away on Bobbie Burns or Wishbone? All he’d
have to do is to give the boys a high-sign and they’d let
him ride to hell, if they thought he was me. Another thing—I
can’t trust all my punchers. Some of them are greasers,
some half-breeds. Money, and not much of it, talks
pretty loud to some of those boys.”</p>

<p>“At present, the person I suspect has no intention of
leaving the place.”</p>

<p>“When you don’t know anything else, how can you
know that?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say that I didn’t know anything else.”</p>

<p>“Do you know, and will you tell me, why you can’t
put this fellow where the dogs won’t bite him, while you
are collecting the proof, evidence, and so on that you
think you need?”</p>

<p>“For one reason, because I am not a police detective.
Sometimes it is necessary to use their methods of
arresting each suspect and getting the evidence afterward—third
degrees, so on. That method, by the way, accounts
for the number of criminals who are able to make
complete escapes. It is a stupid, bungling method—and a
brutal one. I detest it. I have used it only twice in the
seven years that I have been in this work. I used it then
because it was necessary. I will not use it now, because it
is not necessary. This case will come to the grand jury
complete, with indisputable proofs. If I had
known—suspected I mean, before Mr. Canneziano was killed,
what I now suspect——” She stopped short, evidently
afraid of saying too much.</p>

<p>“Ye’a,” Sam argued, “but nothing has happened since
then. What I can’t get, is how you think you are ever
going to find the proof—the evidence.”</p>

<p>“Well——” she began. “Because,” she finished, quite
tartly, and walked out of the room.</p>

<p>“ ‘Because,’ ” Sam mimicked, almost before she was
out of hearing distance. “It was a black day for me, and
for the Desert Moon, when I put this thing up to a
‘because’ woman.”</p>

<p>I more than half agreed with him, but I was not going
to let him know it. “Did you notice,” I questioned,
chiefly to turn his mind from the subject of “because”
women, “that she kept saying that she thought the
person she suspected was on the place? I mean—she didn’t
say that he was living in the house.”</p>

<p>“House! Hell! Of course she didn’t say house. Why
should she say house? Haven’t we been over and over it?
Aren’t we fair frazzled out, every last one of us, from
climbing up those front and back stairs, with our minds,
all day long and half the night? Counting minutes, counting
seconds; going to the barn and back, over and over.
Nobody who lives in this house could have done it. That
is settled. That is fact. Not unless some one of us was
able to be in two places at the same time between four
and five o’clock that day.”</p>

<p>Something clicked in my mind. I declare to goodness,
I felt the click, plain as a twinge of toothache. It scared
me. I put both my hands over the place in the front of
my head. I felt as dazed, and as shaken, as if I had been
sleep-walking, and had bumped into a door, in the dark,
and wakened to find myself in a strange, brightly lighted
room.</p>

<p>“No sir‑ee,” Sam went on, too busy with his own ideas,
I suppose, to notice my actions, which must have been
peculiar, “if the murderer is still on the place, he is
skulking around here in hiding. It is that strangler fellow, all
right. I’ll bet my last dollar on it. For some reason, he is
trying to clean out the Canneziano family—all of them.
I’ll bet he told Martha to give the poison to Danny, not
knowing what a child Martha was—or, maybe, knowing
it. Martha, supposing the poison was candy, or something
nice, ate it up herself. I tell you what, I’m going to do
some proof hunting, now, on my own hook. If I find some
stranger hiding out on this place, that will be good enough
proof for Sam Stanley, and for any jury in Nevada.</p>

<p>“Of course, Mary, it hasn’t been so hard on you—not
having to feel the responsibility the way I have. But
I’ve come to the end of my rope. I’m going to use my
own head, now. I’ve got to get an expert here, for one
thing, to watch and guard over Danny. . . . Say, what’s
the matter with you, Mary? You look so funny. Do you
feel sick, or something?”</p>

<p>“ ‘Something,’ ” I said, “but, at that, I suppose it isn’t
near as bad as feeling responsibility.”</p>

<p>If I’d stayed there listening to him for one more
minute I’d have burst. I left him, and went running, like
the crazy thing I was, up the back stairs to my own room.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LVI. <br> A Whisper</h2>

<p>I stayed in my room for half an hour, thinking with
all my might that I was thinking. At the end of that
time, discovering that I had not turned out one single
rational thought, I gave it up and went to find John.</p>

<p>I forgot all about the men who were guarding the ranch.
I went straight down to the outfit’s quarters. I hadn’t
been on the back of a horse for more than ten years. I
got a lazy puncher to stop doing nothing long enough to
saddle an old nag for me, and boost me up on her, and
off I went.</p>

<p>Jogging along through the clean, clear air, I at last
began really to do some thinking. I came to my senses in
consequence. It was high time. I turned the nag around
and rode back to the outfit’s quarters. I slid off of her,
and left her there, and went walking to the house.</p>

<p>It was fortunate that I had given up my wild goose
chase. There on the porch sat John, talking to Miss
MacDonald. When I got close enough to them to see
how he looked, I felt as if my heart would break for him.
He looked, in spite of his tan, like death.</p>

<p>When I had reached the foot of the steps, both of them,
without saying an aye, yes, nor no to me, got up and
went into the house.</p>

<p>My legs were shaking under me. I had to go slowly
up the steps. Neither John nor Miss MacDonald was in
the living-room when I got there. I went on into the
kitchen.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald was putting on her big apron. Zinnia
was clattering the silver in the dining-room.</p>

<p>“John knows, doesn’t he?” I questioned.</p>

<p>“Knows?”</p>

<p>“I think that I know what you——”</p>

<p>“Don’t!” she shot out at me, and I wouldn’t have
jumped any higher if she had shot a gun instead of a
word.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” she calmed down and came over to me and
spoke in a whisper, “say anything in here. Not
anything.”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to,” I said. “I’m human. You listen to me.”
I whispered it, right into her ear.</p>

<p>I hadn’t half finished what I had to say before she
moved away from me; but she nodded her head, with
those quick, short little nods that always mean
confidential agreement.</p>

<p>For almost an hour I had been thinking that I knew
it. That nodding of hers made me realize that I had only
feared it; that I had believed that she could deny and
disprove it.</p>

<p>I had planned biscuits for dinner. I went and got out
the bread-board, and opened the floor bin, but I couldn’t
do it.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry,” I said, and to my disgust I began to cry.
“I guess you’ll have to make out to do alone, for a while.
I—I’m not feeling well. I’ll have to go and lie down——”</p>

<p>Still blubbering and blind with tears I went upstairs,
and bumped into Sam, standing outside John’s door.
I dried my eyes and saw that he was holding his six-gun,
ready for shooting, in his hand.</p>

</div>

<hr class="x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter" id="ch57">

<h2>CHAPTER LVII. <br> Grief</h2>

<p>“What is the matter with you?” I demanded.
“What are you doing with that gun?”</p>

<p>“John is in there packing his valise. He says he is going
to leave the place. I say he is not.”</p>

<p>“Going to say it with the six-gun, if necessary, ugh?”
I asked.</p>

<p>“If necessary, Mary, by God, he put it up to me,
straight. He came to me, and said that he had to get off
the place for a while. Had to. I baited him along. Asked
him where he wanted to go. He didn’t even try to hide his
feelings. Didn’t bother to make up an excuse. Said it was
all the same to him where he went: ’Frisco, Reno, Salt
Lake, anywhere, just so that he could get away. When
I reckoned he’d stay right here, he up with the idea of
going down to live with the outfit. He’s a fool; so he
thinks that I am. Thinks I don’t know he could get a good
horse, the first night——”</p>

<p>“If John thinks you’re a fool,” I said, “he’s paying
you too much respect. I can’t think of anything much
worse, or more dangerous than a fool, but whatever it is,
you are it. It turns me all over to look at you. Give me
that gun.”</p>

<p>I reached out and took it. His fingers didn’t stick to it
very long. I judged that he was not quite as eager to
shoot John on sight as he had been pretending to be.</p>

<p>“Now get yourself away from here,” I said. “Get on
downstairs, if you know the way, and eat your dinner.
I’ll look after John.”</p>

<p>“If you help that boy to escape——”</p>

<p>“Escape your foot!” I slipped into John’s room, shut
the door in Sam’s face, and pushed the new bolt into its
slot.</p>

<p>John’s things were all strewn about; his valise was
standing open on a chair, but he had stopped trying to
pack it. He was lying face down on the bed.</p>

<p>I went and sat on the bed beside him and put an arm
around his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Mary?” he questioned.</p>

<p>“Yes. There, there now, John dear. Try to brace
up——”</p>

<p>“You don’t know!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I do know, dear. I know just what you know.”</p>

<p>“My God,” he groaned. “It is certain, then? I still
had a little hope. I—I can’t keep on with life, not after
this. When I think of these last weeks—— I—I’m filthy,
I tell you.”</p>

<p>“John, dear,” I tried to comfort. “You didn’t
know—you couldn’t. You aren’t to blame. You are young——”</p>

<p>I knew that I had no comfort for agony such as his,
but I could not bear to leave him; so I stayed, hoping,
as I suppose foolish women have always hoped, that just
plain, quiet loving him might help a little.</p>

<p>After a minute or two, he said, “Mary—if you don’t
mind, I—I’ve got to fight this out alone.”</p>

<p>I went to my own room. I put a cold water compress
on my eyes, and pulled down the window-shades and lay
on my bed. I was mortal tired from sorrow, and the hurt
in my heart for John was sharp as a neuralgia pain, but
my mind went working right along, independent of my
feelings; straight on, like a phonograph, if somebody had
started it, might keep right on grinding out a tune while
the ship that it was on was sinking.</p>

<p>When Miss MacDonald came up, bringing me some
dinner, which I couldn’t touch, I said to her: “It seems
true, but I know that it can’t be. It is too impossible.
I mean—too far fetched.”</p>

<p>“Not a bit of it,” she said. “The only impossible thing
about it is the length of time it has taken us to discover
it. Of course—forgive me, Mrs. Magin, I was almost on
the trail once, I had at least started in the right direction,
and then you threw me completely off.”</p>

<p>“I! How?”</p>

<p>She smiled at me. “By seeing something which you did
not see. But you are not in the least to blame for that.
The fault is all mine.”</p>

<p>She went and shut my transom. She looked through
my clothes-closet. She looked under my bed, saying, as
she did so, “The proverbial practise of old maids, you
know.” She came and sat close beside me, “Now then . . .”
she said.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch58">

<h2>CHAPTER LVIII. <br> The Puzzle</h2>

<p>“Listen. Bit by bit it works into the whole, like a
picture puzzle—each segment slipping right into
place. There is just one hole in it all, and I think your
Danny’s kindness and unselfishness will supply that
necessary bit.”</p>

<p>She began then—to use her own way of saying it—to
put together the pieces of the puzzle. She was right. Bit
by bit it fitted together. Almost at once she came to the
place that she had called a hole.</p>

<p>“There is no hole there,” I told her. “Under those
circumstances, Danny would have been just sweet, and
unselfish, and foolish enough to have done that very
thing. She did it. That was why she was worried and
unhappy, all that day.”</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it. Now then . . .” She went on: Danny’s
calling after Gaby that day—easy to understand now, of
course, and leading straight to Chad’s suicide and
confessional note. Gaby’s fear; Martha’s murder; Sam’s
ashes on the bag; Gaby’s note to Danny; each one fitting
right into place, until spread in front of me was one of
the most hideous pictures that any human being has ever
been forced to look at.</p>

<p>“Only,” I gasped, “there can’t be such wickedness in
the world! I mean—not such long wickedness.”</p>

<p>“In all my experience,” she said, “I have never
investigated another murder case where the thing was so
cruelly, vilely premeditated; so wickedly, cunningly carried
out. If this is true, it will be, also, the first time that
I have found a really brilliant mind belonging to a
fiend.”</p>

<p>“If it is true!” I echoed. “But it is proven. You have
just proven it all to me.”</p>

<p>She shook her head. “We have a seemingly perfect
fabric made up, wholly, of circumstantial evidence. As
yet, we have nothing else. Now I have a question to ask
you. It will seem to you that I should have asked you
this at least a week ago. I did not, because I was certain
that, unless I shared all of my suspicions with you, your
answer would be exactly the answer that you gave me
before. Now, thinking as you think, I want a very careful
answer to this question.”</p>

<p>When she had asked it, I refused my first impulse to
answer it, at once, and sat thinking carefully for several
minutes. The answer that I was forced to give, then,
made me sick with shame.</p>

<p>“No,” I said, “I didn’t. I thought, honestly, that I did.
But now I know that I didn’t. That—that,” I knew I was
chattering it, “puts Canneziano’s murder right at my
door——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense,” she folded one of my trembling hands into
her steady, capable hands. “We can’t go poking about
like that, into the machinery of fate, and stay sane. The
blame in this case is entirely for me. But, if I had not
allowed myself to be misled then, but had worked straight
on, something equally tragic might have happened. We
don’t know. What we do know is, that no more time
must be wasted.</p>

<p>“I have spent this past week in trying to obtain the
necessary proof. I have failed. Now, I am going to ask
you to help me. Will you?”</p>

<p>“I will, and gladly. But you’ll have to tell me what
you want me to do. I haven’t the faintest idea.”</p>

<p>She told me.</p>

<p>“Lands alive!” I said. “That ought to be easy.”</p>

<p>I could see that she was annoyed. “I haven’t found it
so,” she said. “I have made three attempts, as many as
I dared make, this week, and have failed. Do you realize
that it must come simply, and naturally? You must
realize that——”</p>

<p>“See here,” I interrupted, “why not do as Sam wants
you to do? Why not arrest the criminal now, and force
the proof, afterwards? This sort of evidence could be
gotten then, as well as now, and a lot safer, too, it seems
to me.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Magin,” she said, “until we have evidence of
guilt we have no criminal to arrest. Incredible as it seems,
we might still be wrong concerning every bit of this. I
once made a horrible mistake. It was on my third case—that
is, after I began to work for myself. I don’t talk
about it. I can’t think about it. But I made myself a
promise then, a promise that I have never broken, and
which I never will break. Except in extreme necessity,
proof, positive, and perfect, must come before any accusation
or arrest in a case of mine. Twice, as I have said, I
have had men arrested because of circumstantial
evidence. Each time the evidence was far stronger than
anything we have in this case. The first time, the man
would have undoubtedly escaped if he had not been put
in confinement. The second time was on my third case,
which I have mentioned. If you force me to make this
the third time——”</p>

<p>“I can’t force you to do anything,” I reminded her,
hoping to cool her down a bit.</p>

<p>“Yes, you can. If you go at this so clumsily that you
give the thing away, and so endanger your own life, I
shall have to force matters. I must, of course, risk a
reputation—I’m not speaking of my own, you understand—in
preference to risking a life—again I am not speaking
of my own. But, if we are wrong in this, and remember
<em>we may be</em>—circumstantial evidence is the trickiest thing
in the world—it would be bitterly cruel and wrong. It
would be even worse than the other mistake of mine.
Will you remember that, when you make your first
attempt?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll remember. When do you want me to make
the first attempt?”</p>

<p>“As soon as possible. This afternoon, if you can do it.”</p>

<p>“But—how shall I do it?”</p>

<p>“I am going to leave that to you, and to your natural
wit. You can do it much more spontaneously if you are
not attempting to follow set directions. But do, do be
careful. Don’t make a mistake.”</p>

<p>With that she left me. I am ashamed to say that excitement
had made me forget my sorrow. I sat there saying
my prayers, planning, and shaking in my shoes, for a
good half hour before I could get up enough courage to
go downstairs. In all probability, the next hour would
bring me face to face with the murderous fiend; and not
by the blink of an eye, not by the ghost of a shiver, must
I betray my horrible knowledge.</p>

<div class="chapter" id="ch59">

<h2>CHAPTER LIX. <br> The Fatal Mistake</h2>

<p>When I finally did get myself downstairs, I found
Sam, seemingly alone in the living-room, playing
solitaire. I judged, from the look he gave me, and from
the way he had his shoulders hunched, that he was still
in a right ugly humor.</p>

<p>“Where’s everybody?” I asked.</p>

<p>“Out committing murders, somewhere, likely.”</p>

<p>“That’s a nice way to talk, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>He mumbled something.</p>

<p>“What?” I said. “I can’t hear you when you mutter
like that.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t talk much louder when I told Miss MacDonald
about John’s trying to make a getaway. She heard me
all right. That’s all the good it did. Do you know how
much I trust that woman?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t know. I don’t care, either.”</p>

<p>Sam got out that silly, shrill voice he has for talking
when he is trying to mock a woman, any woman,
and in using it he spoke up, real loudly. “ ‘Well, Mr.
Stanley, why not allow your son to go down and live
with the ranch hands, in their houses, for a time, since he
is so eager to do so?’ ”</p>

<p>“Well, what about that?”</p>

<p>“Ahk!” Sam barked. “She is head over heels in love
with him, that’s a part of what is the matter with her.”</p>

<p>I said, “I wish I thought so.”</p>

<p>“Why do you wish that, Mary?” It was Danny’s
voice. Her white face, with the big, sorrowful eyes, peeked
around the high back of a chair near the fireplace.</p>

<p>I was too taken aback to answer her.</p>

<p>“How long have you been sitting there, eavesdropping,
young lady?” Sam asked.</p>

<p>“I didn’t mean to eavesdrop,” she answered, quietly.
“I am sorry. I was reading, and didn’t hear anything
until you began to mimic Miss MacDonald. I heard all of
that. Why does John wish to go down and live with the
outfit?”</p>

<p>“John and Sam had a little trouble to-day,” I told her.</p>

<p>Sam, with his usual helpfulness in embarrassing situations,
pushed back his chair and went walking fast out of
the room.</p>

<p>“Mary,” she questioned, “why aren’t you my friend
any more?”</p>

<p>“Lands, child,” I said, “if you mean that because I
was wishing Miss MacDonald was in love with John, it
was only because I’ve always reckoned that the more
women in love with a man the better for him. John loves
you. What do you care how many women love him?”</p>

<p>“John doesn’t love me any more. I suppose that was
what he and uncle were quarreling about? John wants to
get away from me, is that it? And Uncle Sam is so good,
and so loyal, that he won’t allow it?”</p>

<p>“Nothing like that,” I scoffed. “It was——” I left
that sentence unfinished, and went into the kitchen.</p>

<p>She followed me. I went straight to the stove and
picked up the lid lifter, which, as usual, when I’m not
there to watch, someone had left sticking up in a stove-lid
to get red hot, instead of hanging it on the hook where
it belonged. I dropped it with a howl; and, wrapping
my hand in my apron, told her to run and get the linseed
oil and limewater, up in the hall bathroom, for me.</p>

<p>I am not saying that I was not to blame. I do say that,
if that fool child Zinnia had not jumped around shouting,
“Sody! Sody! Wet sody’s the best for burns——” and
that, if Mrs. Ricker hadn’t heard her screeching, and
come in, too, and begun asking questions, I certainly
would not have overlooked the fact that, before she went
to minister to my needs, Danny had picked up that
lid-lifter, from where I had dropped it on the floor, and had
hung it on its hook.</p>

<p>She made a quick trip upstairs and down again, with
the bandages, and the lotion. She offered, sweet and
sympathetic, to do up my hand for me. I had noticed, by
that time, that my hand was not smarting much, but I
was too excited to account for it reasonably. I asked Mrs.
Ricker to attend to the bandages. I had another job for
Danny.</p>

<p>“I just came out here,” I said, “to make my weekly
list to send to Telko for supplies. I can’t write with this
wadded up hand. Will you make the list for me, Danny?
Zinnia, please hand her the pad and pencil from the
shelf.”</p>

<p>Zinnia brought it. Danny sat down by the table and
picked up the pencil. My heart thumped in my throat.</p>

<p>“One crate of Fallon melons,” I said.</p>

<p>Danny pushed the pad and pencil across the table to
Mrs. Ricker. “Perhaps you’d as soon make the list for
Mary? I have something to attend to upstairs.”</p>

<p>“Go on, now you’ve started it, Danny,” I said. “You
write such a neat, pretty hand.”</p>

<p>“I presume my writing can be read,” Mrs. Ricker
replied, as she picked up the pencil. “A crate of Fallon
melons, did you say?” She wrote it down. I heard Danny
running up the back stairway.</p>

<p>I felt flat as rolled dough from my disappointment. In
the next minute I had something more than
disappointment to bother me.</p>

<p>“I don’t see,” Zinnia said, “how you made out to burn
yourself on that stove, Mrs. Magin. Miss Canneziano was
out here, just a while ago, wanting to make some tea.
The fire was dead out. She boiled the water on the electric
plate.”</p>

<p>I ran to the stove. It was as cold as winter time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LX. <br> The End</h2>

<p>I suppose it takes more than a minute for one’s wits,
particularly if they happen to be thick wits, to drain
entirely away.</p>

<p>Before mine had completely left me, I had attempted
to telephone to Sam, down in the outfit’s quarters, and
had failed to get a reply to my call. I had told Mrs.
Ricker and Zinnia, trying with all my might to hide my
fear, to run out and find Sam, or Miss MacDonald, or
Hubert Hand, or John—I had forgotten that John was
upstairs in his room—and to bring one or all of them to
the house as quickly as possible. To this day I don’t
know why they went, without a question; but they went,
running. It was the slam of the screen door behind them,
I think, bringing with it as it did the realization of my
aloneness and the memory of Miss MacDonald’s
warning, that turned me clear over to terror.</p>

<p>I shall not describe what I did, nor what I thought,
during the time that I was alone there, downstairs, before
help arrived. The humorously inclined might think such
a description amusing. To me there is nothing amusing
in the spectacle of an old woman being gripped and wrung
by fright. I longed to run from the house; but I felt that
I must stay there to explain the situation to the
others when they came, if they ever did come, and to do
my poor best, since I had made the fatal mistake, to
prevent catastrophe. By clock time, it was only thirty-six
silent minutes that I had to wait before Miss MacDonald
came, alone and unhurried, up the front steps and into
the living-room.</p>

<p>Still holding Sam’s thirty-thirty rifle in my hands—I
had known that I could never use it to shoot at any
living thing, but I had hoped that it might make me look
dangerous—I turned to meet her.</p>

<p>“Don’t point that thing at me,” she commanded.
“Put it down. What are you doing with it? What is the
trouble here?”</p>

<p>Before I could answer her, Sam, Mrs. Ricker and
Zinnia came clattering through the kitchen.</p>

<p>Mrs. Ricker was wringing her hands and saying over
and over, in a voice all broken and mutilated with horror,
“I have gone insane, I have gone insane. I have gone
insane.”</p>

<p>Sam said, “Gabrielle Canneziano just now waved at
us from her window.”</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald turned and ran like a wild thing up
the stairs. Just as she disappeared from our sight the
sound of a pistol’s shot cracked through the place.</p>

<p>I followed the others. I ran up the steps. I stumbled
down the hall, behind them, and into Gabrielle
Canneziano’s room.</p>

<p>I saw Gabrielle Canneziano, her cheeks painted, her
lips reddened, long earrings dangling from her ears, lying
on the couch. Over her breast was a widening spot of
color, staining the fringes of the soft white silk
dressing-gown that she was wearing. On the floor was a smoking
revolver.</p>

<p>John came. He said, “She told me what she was going
to do. I allowed her to do it. I did not want Nevada to
have to execute a woman.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER LXI. <br> Epilogue</h2>

<p>Sam says, bitterly, that the only thing I need to
explain is the one thing that can ever be explained:
how one girl, by changing her clothes and by washing
her face, could turn a houseful of supposedly sensible
people into a packet of blithering, bat-blind fools for
a generous period of time. I can explain that, I think; but
I am going to leave it until later, and go clear back to
the second of July, the day that Gabrielle received the
code letter.</p>

<p>In her talk with John (John says it was in no sense a
confession, that it was nothing but a taunt for us all, a
final, regretless, high fling of defiance) there in his room,
during the twenty minutes or so that she talked to him,
before she shot herself, some things, which might still not
be clear to us, were made plain. Also, many of Miss
MacDonald’s previously formed opinions were directly
or indirectly verified. Miss MacDonald had said, you
remember, that the murder had been wickedly
premeditated.</p>

<p>“When I read that letter,” Gabrielle said to John,
“and found myself penniless and planless on a Nevada
ranch, I at once made up my mind to kill Danielle, the
little fool, and take her place.”</p>

<p>How she persuaded Danny to accept the idea of the
masquerade, and to change clothes with her, on the fourth
of July, we do not positively know. That is the “hole”
that Miss MacDonald mentioned in her puzzle. To my
mind, there is little doubt that she gained her way very
easily, by using her own unhappiness and disappointment
as tools with which to remove Danny’s scruples and prod
her pity. I am sure, remembering Danny’s troubled
manner at the time, that she consented unwillingly, that
she thoroughly disliked the idea, and that she was afraid
of its consequences.</p>

<p>When the two girls went upstairs together, on the
afternoon of the fourth of July, they must have gone to
effect the transformation. Perhaps, then, for a brief
minute or two, the thing did seem amusing to Danny;
for I know that I heard the girls laughing together, as
I have mentioned, when I was on my errand upstairs.</p>

<p>We do not know, when the disguise had been completed,
by what pretext Gabrielle lured Danny into the
attic. Their trunks were in the attic. There could be a
dozen simple reasons why Danny might consent to go
up there with her. Coming downstairs again, Gabrielle
caught her by the throat, and strangled her, instantly,
by means of the deadly jiu-jitsu hold, which she had
learned from her “Strangler” lover. It is a hold that
requires little strength—though Gabrielle’s trained fingers
were strong enough—but much scientific skill.</p>

<p>She took the earrings from Danny’s ears—or, perhaps,
Danny had not yet put them on—went to her own room,
arranged her make-up, got into the wrap, which
completely covered Danny’s clothes that she was wearing,
pulled the hat down over her eyes to conceal the change
in hairdressing, and walked through the living-room, for
us all to see her, at four o’clock.</p>

<p>When Chad went to the porch with her (this John
found out by insistent questioning) she told him that
Danny had left the house, earlier, by the back way. That
she and Danny had arranged a joke on the rest of us, to
enliven the dull afternoon, and asked him to help with it
by calling, in Danny’s voice to her, when he came back
into the house. Chad did it. That was why, since he was
standing down by the front doors, the voice supposed to
come from the upper hall had a strained and an unnatural
sound. Gabrielle had reckoned that Chad, in spite
of her request, would be too stupid to discover the facts.
Probably she thought that, at any rate, she would be able
to impose silence upon him. It was one of her many
mistakes. We think that he must have known for the
remainder of the afternoon that Gabrielle was masquerading
as Danny. His happy mood was caused by the fact
that Gabrielle had given him a confidence and had
allowed him to perform a small service for her. When he
saw what had happened, and when he realized that the
girl whom he had worshipped was a murderer, he killed
himself. Strange, that in spite of everything, he still loved
her enough to leave the confessional note to shield her.
The men think that he left the note to shield the rest of
us, rather than to shield her. I do not believe it.</p>

<p>She had planned to go straight around the house and
re-enter it through the back door. Martha’s being by the
rabbit hutch was something she had not counted on. It
was necessary to distract Martha’s attention, and to get
her to come at once into the house. She gave her the
monkey bracelet. As she did so, probably because of the
act of kindness, Martha made one of her frequent mistakes
and called Gabrielle “Danny.” Gabrielle told John
(concerning Martha, John also questioned her insistently)
that she then showed Martha the poison in the charm,
and told her that it was a love potion that would make
Chad love her, “like a lady,” if she would swallow it, and
never tell anyone anything about it. That, of course,
was Martha’s secret concerning the happy surprise that
had to do with herself and Chad.</p>

<p>Martha out of the way, Gaby must have run quickly
around to the back of the house and up the back stairway.
To toss the hat and wrap back on the body, replace the
earrings, scatter the pipe ashes over the beaded bag (I
declare to goodness, I can more easily think of her lying
there in her white silk dressing-gown, than I can think
of her, brushing those pipe ashes up, from somewhere,
in order to save them for that purpose), and drop the
tatting shuttle there, required not more than one or two
minutes of time. Another two or three minutes to wash
her face thoroughly and to douse on some of Danny’s
perfume, and she was coming downstairs again, with the
headache that necessitated the drawing of the
curtains—to make her safety a bit safer, just at first.</p>

<p>She told John that those few minutes when she had to
walk through the room, make the trip around the house,
and get upstairs again, were the only moments of fright
that she had had, from the first to the last. Once safely
established in the rôle of Danny, she said, she knew that
she had nothing to fear.</p>

<p>I think, however, that there were other times when she
was afraid. I am certain that real fear was there in her
room, that day, when the engagement ring dropped from
her finger. Though I believe that her fear, then, was
caused wholly from superstition, and not from any dread
that the slight difference between her hands and Danny’s
hands might be noticed.</p>

<p>I am sure that her fear for John, on the fourth of July,
was real enough. She knew that each minute he was away,
longer than the time necessary for the trip, was a minute
lost from the perfect alibi she had so mistakenly tried to
arrange for him by sending him away from the ranch.
She had not known that Danny’s fingers had closed on the
stair’s tread. When John came in the back way she was
afraid that it would be remembered later—as it was—and
that someone would suspect—as Hubert Hand did
suspect—that John had carried the body in at that time.</p>

<p>She had counted on her note to Danny, and on the fact
that, as Danny, she was downstairs within ten or twelve
minutes after the time we had seen Gaby walking down
the path and had heard Danny’s voice calling after her,
to prove her own innocence. They, and the gentleness of
Danny’s disposition, did this to perfection.</p>

<p>Her original plan had been to prove that Sam was the
murderer. With Sam out of the way, and with John in
possession of his fortune, she had thought, I suppose, that
she would have no trouble in persuading John to leave the
Desert Moon. But she was afraid of the idea. Knowing
John’s devotion to Sam, she could not reckon, with
any sureness, how disgrace and sorrow might affect
John. It was too big a risk to take, unreservedly. So,
though she picked the quarrel with Sam, strewed the
pipe ashes on the bag, put the key in the fireplace, wrote
on the photograph, she left loopholes in the shapes of the
many other false clues. It is only my own notion that, if
she had not thought the definite accusation of Sam, which
she made during the session on the fifth of July, was
necessary to protect John, she would have backed out, by
that time, and not have made it.</p>

<p>It is again only my notion that the request, which she
put in her note to Danny, to have Danny take her body
to San Francisco for cremation, was made because she
thought that it would be desirable for her to be able to
leave the ranch at once—perhaps for several weeks. Mrs.
Ricker’s expressed suspicion probably made her realize
the wisdom of returning as rapidly as possible to the
Desert Moon.</p>

<p>Gabrielle Canneziano was a born criminal. Almost all
of her life had been spent among criminals. She knew their
ways, and she knew the ways of honest people toward
them. Consequently, she was too clever to drop her
disguise, even for a minute, in San Francisco. When, on the
afternoon of the fourth of July, she had come downstairs
as Danny, she had come resolved from that time forth to
be Danny, in thought and in deed, up to the level best of
her ability. That she never doubted her ability to turn
from black to white within the space of an hour, is a
splendid example of Miss MacDonald’s contention
concerning the egotism of criminals.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald says that her first real clue was the
one I gave to her when I said that no one, except Gaby
herself, who would do such a wicked thing, had ever been
on the ranch. If she had been on the ranch, she might
have committed the murder. She had all three of the
primary motives for murder: love, revenge, and greed.
The unique feature in this case—Miss MacDonald says
that each case has its unique feature—was that the
murdered girl had been a duplicate twin.</p>

<p>The hazy, incomplete notion, Miss MacDonald says,
had just come into her mind; she had not begun to accept
it, she was only allowing it, dimly, to take form,
when I returned to the room that day with my hand full
of letters written by Danny. Handwriting, as surely as
fingerprints, Miss MacDonald says, proves identity.</p>

<p>She asked me, straight, whether I had seen Danny
writing the checks and addressing the envelopes. I
answered, straight and positively, that I had. (And not
twenty minutes before that Miss MacDonald had warned
me that people often thought that they saw things they
did not see.)</p>

<p>I had not. I had seen the person whom I supposed was
Danny writing checks and addressing envelopes. I had
turned my back on her, and had walked to the door, when
she called after me and gave me the envelopes containing
the checks.</p>

<p>Danny herself had written those checks and had addressed
those envelopes on the third of July. Owing to all
the furore that had been going on in the house that day,
she had left her desk before she had torn the checks from
her check-book, and had never gone back to it to finish
her task. It is possible that Gabrielle had deliberately
arranged that, also; but I think not. At any rate, she had
had the checks in her possession, and had waited for a
date that had a three, or an eight in it, to produce them.
Circumstances and I played well into her hands that day;
she had only to insert a one in front of the three to make
me her fool.</p>

<p>Miss MacDonald, as you have seen, blames herself and
not me for the mistake. She says that she should have
known better than to believe me; or, to quote her
exactly, she should have “doubted your accuracy of
observation.” But, not until the morning that we found Daniel
Canneziano murdered did it occur to her to doubt it.</p>

<p>She says that it was not clairvoyance, not intuition,
not even common sense, that it was nothing but a memory
that took her, that morning, straight back to the idea
that Gabrielle Canneziano could be the guilty person.
Oddly, the conviction had come to her before we found
Canneziano’s body.</p>

<p>Sitting across the table from Gabrielle, posing as
Danny, that morning at breakfast, she had thought, idly,
of the breakfast that she and Danny had had together in
the dining-car. She had taken her chair, that morning,
just as Danny had handed the order slip for her breakfast
to the waiter. Too vaguely to be certain that it was really
a memory, she seemed to see that slip of paper covered
with writing. Just then, with the aroma of coffee in her
nostrils, and with her iced grapefruit and rolls in front of
her, she remembered that it was the same breakfast
both she and Danny had had that morning. Would such a
small order cover an order slip with handwriting? Not, it
was certain, with the neat handwriting that had made out
those checks and addressed those envelopes. Right then
she resolved to lose no more time; to get, as soon as
possible, a sample of the handwriting of the girl who was
sitting across the table from her.</p>

<p>Canneziano’s murder, discovered in the next half hour,
strengthened her vague suspicions into as much of a
certainty as she ever allowed herself before she had positive
evidence.</p>

<p>As I have written, she spent the following week in
efforts to get that evidence; at last, fearing that she was
suspected, she detailed the task to me.</p>

<p>You have seen how I failed. How Gabrielle at once
saw through my trick of attempting to disable my
right hand by burning it; and how, realizing that she
was trapped, she had run upstairs, first to satisfy her
longing to be herself again, even for a few brief minutes,
then to taunt John, and, finally, to take her own life.</p>

<p>For I think, in spite of her denials to John, that she
killed herself because she knew that she was trapped,
though her vanity and her audacity held to the end.</p>

<p>“I knew I should have no trouble in making you believe
that silly doll story,” she said. “It was the truth,
I knew, too, that the dick would read the code letter. She
was so slow about it, that I had to steal it to make her
do it. It was time, you see, for the gentle Danielle’s story
to be verified. I knew that the dick had a copy of it—she’d
been baiting me with the thing. I have kept a step or two
ahead of her lumbering pace, all the time.</p>

<p>“Don’t fancy that I had overlooked the matter of the
handwriting. I’m not a fool. I thought of it before I killed
the girl. There were a dozen ways I could have gotten
around it—could yet get around it. If necessary, I could
even have disabled my own right hand. I had rather
planned, at first, to do that. But, later, I found that I
loved my pretty little white hand better than I had
supposed. Just as I have discovered that I loved the gay
Gaby better than I had supposed—so well, indeed, that I
have decided that death as Gaby is infinitely preferable
to life as the shiny nosed Danielle. I have seen this
coming. I have not cared.</p>

<p>“I got rid of that cur, Canneziano, not because I was
afraid of him, but because he tried to double cross me. I
had promised to do much for him, after you and I were
married; and he would have sold me out for a few thousand
dollars. He came here, hoping that Danny might pay
him a pretty sum for his silence about my past. He knew
his muttons. She would have been fool enough to
have done it; poor slain sister stuff; more to be pitied
than blamed—all that, you know. He should have played
with me, instead of against me. I had a few old scores to
settle with him. Most of my rage about the money was
because I had thought it would be such good fun to get
the best of him. And I did—so that is all right. I hid in
his room early that evening. It was frightfully amusing
to watch him locking his door and his windows to make
his sleep a safe one. It was. I did the job so neatly that
he never woke at all.</p>

<p>“For that matter, it has all been amusing. You have
all been such utter fools. But I am tired of it now. Oh,
very tired. Particularly, I am tired of my cruel plan to
destroy the gay Gaby by burying her alive. I am going
now to do it in a swifter, kinder way.”</p>

<p>Sam insists that her success, even for so short a time, is
an indictment against all of us; that it shows that none
of us was capable of looking deeper than clothes and face
paint. I do not agree with him. Gabrielle was a professional
actress. She had lived with Danny long enough to
learn all her ways, her mannerisms, her habits in
conversation. She did not dupe Chad, who loved her, and
who was an expert in voices. She did not dupe Canneziano,
who had known both of the girls all their lives.</p>

<p>The murder itself, by stupefying us all with horror,
with fear, with suspicions, did much to help her. But
without that dulling of our perceptions, I think that the
imposture would have been successful. At the time of the
murder, the two girls had been on the ranch with us less
than two months. Strangers never get much deeper than
surfaces in so short a time. There was nothing remarkable,
it seems to me, about her being able, quite easily,
to deceive all of us, with the single, glaring exception of
John.</p>

<p>John is one of a large class of people who could all be
filed under the recipe for simple acceptors. It is a necessary
class; a class that acts as an oil to the hinges of the
world, making it move smoothly: the gentle, thoroughly
honest class that by quietly believing what it is told to
believe, keeps us out of revolutions, and rebellions, and
the like. I am not saying that the doubters and the rebels
are not necessary (as Sam would say, “It takes that sort
to make all sorts”), but Heaven help us if they
predominated.</p>

<p>When John came home from Rattail, on the fourth of
July, he was faced with the apparent fact that Danny,
in the course of a few hours, had changed essentially.
That was what had bothered him so; what had made him
jerk his head, and blink his eyes, and complain of a touch
of sun. John had never recognized, much less admitted to
himself, that there was the slightest similarity between
the two girls. Consequently, in spite of a change, Danny
must be Danny; she looked like Danny, she talked like
Danny, and we all said that she was Danny. John
believed.</p>

<p>Very shortly after that, John was faced with another
apparent fact. Gaby had been murdered. He could see that,
with his own eyes, as we all could see it.</p>

<p>He at once set the fact of Danny’s change against the
fact of Gaby’s murder—and there he stuck fast; too
loyal to go further; too dismayed to retreat. He did not
believe that Danny had killed Gabrielle. He had known
Danny too well to harbor such a belief. He was forced to
believe that she knew who had done it. Consequently, her
accusation of Sam could be nothing but a wicked
accusation. Only—Danny could not be wicked.</p>

<p>The mystery was a torture which Danny’s presence
intensified unbearably; so he avoided her; and, unable to
blame her for anything, blamed himself and hated himself
for his suspicions and for his failing loyalty. I’ll venture,
though it can be only a venture, that the realization
of his interest in Miss MacDonald, and his inability to be
rid of it, was another cause for John’s befuddlement.</p>

<p>That interest, of course, has all disappeared for the
present. Though he despised himself for it, John might
have been untrue to a changed, living Danny; might, in
the end, have jilted her meanly. John is male. But to a
Danny who is no longer living, John, now, must always
be true. John is young. I reckon he has fine honest plans
for being faithful to her memory for the remainder of his
life. Miss MacDonald is also young, and lovely, and heart
whole. She has promised to come and visit us for a month
next June.</p>

<p>Just now, with our thermometers at fifty below zero,
and our chilblains burning, and the coyotes piercing the
nights with their lank, long, frozen screeches, and the cold
old owls always grieving forth their mournful “chuck-a-loo,
whoo, whoo, whoo’s” June looks mighty far away.</p>

<p>But, five fingers and a thumb, and she will be here,
smelling of sunshine and tasting like smiles; painting our
deserts with rainbow colors for as far as the eyes can see;
spreading sunsets that catch you right up into their
midsts; offering dawns that share their youth with you
and that make you believe all over again in things which
you had long ago stopped believing. Now I don’t know
shucks about romance; but I have a notion that June, in
our northeastern Nevada, stirs up whole batches of the
stuff. I am counting on her to serve it, fresh and sweet,
this year.</p>

<p>It isn’t June, though, and it isn’t romance that I
am trusting for the final chore: it is something more
lasting than either, something sturdier, something for
which I can not find a name. But I know that it is
induced by a mixture of long years of right living, and
clean thinking, and sanity, and courage; so I am expecting
it to clear away the shadows from the Desert Moon
and leave it, riding high as it used to ride, high and
proud, a brave, shining thing in our valley.</p>
